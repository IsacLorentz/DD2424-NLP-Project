Second Citizen:
One word, good citizens.

First Citizen:
We be accounted inadequate citizens, the aristocrat good.
What self assurance surfeits on would relieve us: if they
would take us simply the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we might think they relieved us humanely;
but they remember we are too beloved the leanness that
afflicts us, the target of our misery, is as an
inventory to specialise their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them rent us retaliate this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the graven image lie with I
speak this in hunger for bread, non in thirst for revenge.

First Citizen:
Very wellspring and could be content to open him good
report fort, but that he make up himself with follow proud.

Second Citizen:
Nay, but utter non maliciously.

it to that terminate though soft-conscienced humans can be
content to pronounce it evergreen state for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
is, yet till the altitude of his virtue.

All:
Come, come.

Second Citizen:
Worthy Menenius agrippa one that hath always loved
the people.

First Citizen:
He's unrivalled honest sufficiency would completely the rest were so!

MENENIUS:
What work's, my countrymen, in hired hand where go you
With bats and nine The topic speak, I pray you.

MENENIUS:
I tell you, quaker virtually charitable care
Have the blue blood of you. For your wants,
Your abide in this dearth, you whitethorn as well
Strike at the nirvana with your stave in as lift them
Against the romanic state, whose course volition on
The way it choose cracking ten thousand curbs
Of thomas more strong link apart than backside ever
Appear in your obstruction For the dearth,
The divinity not the aristocrat make it, and
Your knee joint to them, non arms, must help. Alack,
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more than attends you, and you slander
The helms o' the department of state who care for you wish fathers,
When you damn them as enemies.

First Citizen:
Care for us! confessedly indeed! They ne'er cared for us
yet: suffer us to hunger and their store-houses
crammed with texture make edicts for usury, to
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich, and ply more
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
the pitiable If the wars eat us non up, they testament and
there's altogether the jazz they behave us.

MENENIUS:
Sir, I shall william tell you. With a variety of smile,
Which nee came from the lungs, but yet thus--
For, wait you, I crataegus laevigata pee the belly smile
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you evil our senators for that
They are non such as you.

MENENIUS:
What then?
'Fore me, this feller speaks! What then? what then?

First Citizen:
The previous agents, if they did complain,
What could the venter answer?

MENENIUS:
'Though whole at one time cannot
See what I do turn in stunned to each,
Yet I give the sack make my scrutinize up, that all
From me do spinal column take in the flour of all,
And give me just the bran.' What pronounce you to't?

First Citizen:
I the peachy toenail why the great toe?

First Citizen:
We stimulate ever your sound word.

MARCIUS:
They live dissolved: attend 'em!
They aforesaid they were an-hungry; sigh'd away proverbs,
That hunger discover stone walls, that andiron must eat,
That meat was made for mouthpiece that the graven image sent not
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
They air their quetch which equal answer'd,
And a postulation granted them, a strange one--
To cave in the heart of generosity,
And make bold power look pale--they confuse their caps
As they would bent them on the horns o' the moon,
Shouting their emulation.

MARCIUS:
Here: what's the matter?

MARCIUS:
I am gladiolus on 't: then we shall ha' substance to vent
Our fusty superfluity. See, our proficient elders.

MARCIUS:
They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that bequeath position you to 't.
I hell in begrudge his nobility,
And were I any thing but what I am,
I would wish me only he.

COMINIUS:
You take in oppose together.

MARCIUS:
Sir, it is;
And I am incessant Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt meet me in one case more strike at Tullus' face.
What, artwork thou stiff? stand'st out?

TITUS:

Ere bide behind this business.

BRUTUS:
Being moved, he bequeath not spare to build up the gods.

SICINIUS:
Be-mock the small scale moon.

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half wholly Cominius' pureness are to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them non and entirely his faults
To Marcius shall be respect though indeed
In null he deserve not.

First Senator:
So, your judgement is, Aufidius,
That they of capital of italy are entered in our counsels
And be intimate how we proceed.

First Senator:
Our army's in the field
We neer notwithstanding pass water uncertainty but Rome was ready
To answer us.

AUFIDIUS:
Nor did you think it folly
To stay fresh your neat pretense veil'd boulder clay when
They indigence must show themselves; which
in the hatching,
It seem'd, appear'd to eternal city By the discovery.
We shall be shorten'd in our intention which was
To take in many towns ere near Rome
Should know we were afoot.

AUFIDIUS:
O, doubt non that;
I verbalize from certainties. Nay, more,
Some parcels of their power equal forth already,
And only hitherward. I allow your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius take a chance to meet,
'Tis bank between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more.

All:
Farewell.

VIRGILIA:
But had he died in the line madam; how then?

VOLUMNIA:
Indeed, you shall not.
Methinks I see hither your hubby drum,
See him soak Aufidius drink down by the hair,
As kid from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
Methinks I get word him postage stamp therefore and outcry thus:
'Come on, you cowards! you embody mystify in fear,
Though you personify born in capital of italy his bally brow
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Or all or mislay his hire.

VOLUMNIA:
Sweet madam.

VIRGILIA:
I thank your ladyship; intimately good madam.

VALERIA:
O' my password the founding father son: I'll swear,'tis a
very moderately boy. O' my troth, I count upon him o'
Wednesday one half an hour in concert has such a
confirmed countenance. I take in him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he watch it, he allow it go
again; and afterward it once again and oer and all over he
comes, and once again overhear it once again or whether his
fall infuriated him, or how 'twas, he coiffure so go down his
teeth and tear it; O, I stock warrant it, how he mammocked
it!

VIRGILIA:
'Tis non to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA:
Verily, I do not gag with you; in that respect occur intelligence from
him last night.

VIRGILIA:
Give me let off skilful madam; I leave obey you in every

LARTIUS:
So, the thoroughly horse is mine.

MARCIUS:

For one half a century years. Summon the town.

MARCIUS:
How far off lie these armies?

MARCIUS:
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, deflower I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoking steel whitethorn march from hence,
To help our fielded quaker Come, bump thy blast.
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

MARCIUS:
They concern us not, but offspring forth their city.
Now set your shield in front your inwardness and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:
They do patronage us lots beyond our thoughts,
Which makes me sudor with ira Come on, my fellows:
He that retires complaint take him for a Volsce,
And he shall sense mine edge.

MARCIUS:
All the transmission of the to the south light on you,
You disgrace of rome you crowd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you english hawthorn be abhorr'd
Further than visualise and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
That bear the mould of adult male how throw you run
From buckle down that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All offend behind; backs red, and faces pale
With escape and agued fear! patch and charge home,
Or, by the evoke of heaven, I'll bequeath the foe
And cook my wars on you: tone tote up come on;
If you'll brook fast, we'll beatnik them to their wives,
As they us to our ditch followed.
So, like a shot the bill gates are ope: now rise good seconds:
'Tis for the follower fortune broaden them,
Not for the fliers: marking me, and do the like.

First Soldier:
Fool-hardiness; non I.

LARTIUS:
What is become of Marcius?

First Soldier:
Following the throwaway at the rattling heels,
With them he embark who, upon the sudden,
Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
To serve whole the city.

Second Roman:
And I this.

Messenger:
The citizens of Corioli have issued,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
I witness our party to their impinge driven,
And then I get along away.

COMINIUS:
'Tis not a air mile briefly we pick up their drums:
How couldst thousand in a knot fox an hour,
And get thy news so late?

COMINIUS:
Who's yonder,
That serve seem as he constitute flay'd? O gods
He birth the mould of Marcius; and I have
Before-time learn him thus.

MARCIUS:
O, let me clip ye
In arms as level headed as when I sir henry wood in heart
As lively as when our nuptial day was done,
And wax light burn'd to bedward!

MARCIUS:
As with a valet de chambre busied about decrees:
Condemning some to decease and just about to exile;
Ransoming him, or condole with minatory the other;
Holding Corioli in the describe of Rome,
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let him parapraxis at will.

COMINIUS:
But how prevail'd you?

COMINIUS:
Marcius,
We rich person at disfavour fought and did
Retire to succeed our purpose.

MARCIUS:
How dwell their engagement know you on which side
They hold placed their men of trust?

COMINIUS:
As I gauge Marcius,
Their bands i' the vaward embody the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very nerve of hope.

COMINIUS:
March on, my fellows:
Make good this splashiness and you shall
Divide in whole with us.

LARTIUS:
So, let the porthole be defend keep your duties,
As I have place them down. If I do beam dispatch
Those century to our attention the rest will serve
For a unforesightful holding: if we miss the field,
We cannot keep back the town.

Lieutenant:
Fear non our guardianship sir.

AUFIDIUS:
We hate alike:
Not Afric own a ophidian I abhor
More than thy celebrity and enviousness Fix thy foot.

MARCIUS:
Let the starting time budger break the other's slave,
And the divinity doom him after!

MARCIUS:
Within these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And make up what work I proud of cordyline terminalis not my blood
Wherein one thousand seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy index to the highest.

COMINIUS:
Should they not,
Well power they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
And collapsible shelter themselves with end Of all the horses,
Whereof we give birth ta'en ripe and good memory of all
The cherish in this field of operations achieve and city,
We supply you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the plebeian distribution, at
Your only choice.

MARCIUS:
May these same pawn which you profane,
Never vocalise more! when drums and trumpets shall
I' the field shew flatterers, let courts and cities be
Made altogether of false-faced soothing!
When steel grows easy as the parasite's silk,
Let him be relieve oneself a coverture for the wars!
No thomas more I pronounce For that I hold not wash'd
My nose that phlebotomise or foil'd some debile wretch.--
Which, without note, here's many else consume done,--
You shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical;
As if I loved my minuscule should be dieted
In praise sauced with lies.

CORIOLANUS:
I volition go wash;
And when my face is carnival you shall perceive
Whether I flush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
I mingy to pace your steed, and at entirely times
To undercrest your good addition
To the fairness of my power.

CORIOLANUS:
The supreme being begin to bemock me. I, that now
Refused most princely gifts, am tie up to beg
Of my jehovah general.

COMINIUS:
Take't; ti yours. What is't?

AUFIDIUS:
Bolder, though non so insidious My valiancy poison'd
With entirely suffering stain by him; for him
Shall tent fly out of itself: nor nap nor sanctuary,
Being raw sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The entreaty of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements altogether of fury, shall elevation up
Their crappy privilege and custom 'gainst
My hatred to Marcius: where I recover him, were it
At abode upon my brother's guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canyon would I
Wash my savage hand in's inwardness Go you to the city;
Learn how ti held; and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.

First Soldier:
Will not you go?

MENENIUS:
The augurer tell me we shall get news to-night.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, world health organization does the wildcat love?

MENENIUS:
Ay, to down him; as the thirsty plebeians would the
noble Marcius.

Both:
Well, sir.

SICINIUS:
Especially in pride.

MENENIUS:
This is unusual now: do you ii have sex how you are
censured hither in the metropolis I hateful of us o' the
right-hand register do you?

Both:
Well, intimately sir, well.

BRUTUS:
Come, sir, semen we experience you advantageously enough.

MENENIUS:
You know neither me, yourselves nor any matter You
are ambitious for piteous knaves' cap and legs: you
wear proscribed a upright wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange tree wife and a fosset-seller;
and and then rejourn the controversy of triplet centime to a
second daytime of interview When you are discover a
matter between party and party, if you chance to be
pinched with the intestinal colic you score expression like
mummers; determine up the flaming flag against all
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the contestation bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: all the pacification you make in their
cause is, calling both the political party knaves. You surface area pair of unusual ones.

VIRGILIA:
Yes, sure there's a letter for you; I saw't.

MENENIUS:
A letter for me! it gives me an the three estates of seven
years' wellness in which metre I will make a lip at
the medico the most sovereign prescription in
Galen is simply empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
of no break composition than a horse-drench. Is he
not wound he make up wont to come dwelling house wounded.

VALERIA:
In troth, there's tremendous things utter of him.

VIRGILIA:
The gods grant them true!

VOLUMNIA:
He birth before this hold out expedition, twenty-five
wounds upon him.

Herald:
Know, eternal city that all alone Marcius did fight
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
With celebrity a name to Caius Marcius; these
In reward follows Coriolanus.
Welcome to rome famous Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
No more of this; it does go against my heart:
Pray at once no more.

CORIOLANUS:
Know, expert mother,
I ingest preferably be their servant in my way,
Than carry with them in theirs.

BRUTUS:
All natural language verbalize of him, and the blur sights
Are monocled to see him: your blabber nurse
Into a exaltation lets her baby cry
While she schmooze him: the kitchen malkin pins
Her plentiful lockram binge her reechy neck,
Clambering the surround to heart him: conk bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, top fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In serious mindedness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do squeeze among the pop mob and puff
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Of apollo burning snog such a pother
As if that whatsoever god who star him
Were slily crept into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture.

BRUTUS:
Then our office may,
During his might go sleep.

SICINIUS:
He cannot abstemiously transport his honours
From where he should get and end, simply will
Lose those he hath won.

BRUTUS:
It be his give voice O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the accommodate of the aristocracy to him,
And the want of the nobles.

BRUTUS:
So it mustiness fall out
To him or our self confidence For an end,
We must propose the people in what hatred
He yet hath reserve them; that to's baron he would
Have shit them mule silenced their pleader and
Dispropertied their exemption holding them,
In man litigate and capacity,
Of no to a greater extent soul nor fitness for the world
Than camel in the warfare who have their provand
Only for mien burdens, and mad blows
For drop down under them.

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol;
And channel with us pinna and eyes for the time,
But affection for the event.

First Officer:
Come, get they personify most here. How many stand
for consulships?

MENENIUS:
Having find of the Volsces and
To institutionalize for Titus Lartius, it remains,
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
To indulge his imposing avail that
Hath thus stood for his area therefore,
please you,
Most reverend and dangerous elders, to desire
The submit consul, and cobblers last general
In our well-found achiever to report
A picayune of that desirable mold perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
We cope with here both to give thanks and to remember
With abide by like himself.

MENENIUS:
Masters of the people,
Your procreate spawn how tin he flatter--
That's grand to one good one--when you right away see
He receive rather venture whole his limbs for honour
Than  on's pinna to hear it? go on Cominius.

MENENIUS:
He's right noble:
Let him be call'd for.

CORIOLANUS:
It is apart
That I shall bloom in act and might well
Be taken from the people.

BRUTUS:
Mark you that?

BRUTUS:
You discover how he specify to utilisation the people.

SICINIUS:
May they perceive's intent! He leave require them,
As if he do contemn what he requested
Should be in them to give.

First Citizen:
Once, if he do command our vox we ought non to deny him.

Second Citizen:
Why that way?

Third Citizen:
To mislay itself in a cloud where exist three parts
melted out with shitty dews, the fourth would return
for conscience interest to assist to father thee a wife.

Second Citizen:
You comprise never without your conjuring trick you crataegus laevigata you may.

All:
Content, content.

MENENIUS:
O me, the gods!
You mustiness not talk of that: you mustiness desire them
To think upon you.

CORIOLANUS:
Think upon me! knack 'em!
I would they would bury me, like the virtues
Which our divines turn a loss by 'em.

CORIOLANUS:
Bid them wash off their faces
And keep their teeth clean.
So, hither comes a brace.
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.

Third Citizen:
We do, sir; order us what hath brought you to't.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, but not mine have desire.

CORIOLANUS:
Well so I pray, your monetary value o' the consulship?

First Citizen:
The price is to require it kindly.

CORIOLANUS:
Kindly! sir I implore let me chapeau I birth wounds to
show you, which shall be yours in individual Your
good vocalization sir; what enounce you?

CORIOLANUS:
Pray you at present if it whitethorn stand with the melodic line of your
voices that I may be consul, I take here the
customary gown.

Fourth Citizen:
You ingest deserved nobly of your area and you
have non deserved nobly.

Fifth Citizen:
We promise to find you our friend; and thus give
you our spokesperson heartily.

Both Citizens:
The god give you joy, sir, heartily!

SICINIUS:
You crataegus oxycantha sir.

MENENIUS:
I'll hold back you ships company Will you along?

SICINIUS:
How forthwith my masters! give you take this man?

First Citizen:
He has our voices, sir.

Second Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my pitiful unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

First Citizen:
No,'tis his genial of spoken language he did non bemock us.

SICINIUS:
Why, so he exercise I am sure.

Third Citizen:
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his chapeau thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be consul,' allege he: 'aged custom,
But by your vocalise bequeath not so allow me;
Your interpreter therefore.' When we given that,
Here was 'I give thanks you for your vocalise thank you:
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
your voices,
I take in no further with you.' embody not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
Why either follow you unlearned to see't,
Or, see it, of such infantile friendliness
To yield your voices?

BRUTUS:
Did you perceive
He make out solicit you in disembarrass contempt
When he practice need your jazz and do you think
That his scorn shall non be spite to you,
When he hath ability to squelch Why, had your bodies
No inwardness among you? or own you tongues to cry
Against the rectorate of judgment?

Second Citizen:
And volition traverse him:
I'll give birth five one hundred voices of that sound.

BRUTUS:
Lay
A fault on us, your tribune that we laboured,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.

BRUTUS:
Ay, spare us not. state we take lectures to you.
How youngly he set out to function his country,
How long preserve and what stock he jump of,
The baronial house o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's girl son,
Who, afterwards great Hostilius, hither was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our pose water brought by conduit hither;
And  
Twice being  
Was his cracking ancestor.

SICINIUS:
One thus descended,
That hath beside well in his someone wrought
To be adjust gamy in place, we did commend
To your remembrances: but you take in found,
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
That atomic number  your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approbation.

SICINIUS:
To the Capitol, come:
We volition be on that point before the stream o' the people;
And this shall appear as part cordyline terminalis their own,
Which we own goaded onward.

LARTIUS:
He make my godhead and that it be which caused
Our swifter composition.

COMINIUS:
They personify worn, lord consul, so,
That we shall hardly in our age see
Their banner wave again.

CORIOLANUS:
How? what?

CORIOLANUS:
What pretend this change?

COMINIUS:
Hath he non pass'd the nobleman and the common?

CORIOLANUS:
Have I get children's voices?

BRUTUS:
The masses represent umbrageous against him.

CORIOLANUS:
Are these your herd?
Must these give voices, that stool yield them now
And true disclaim their spit What are
your offices?
You equal their mouths, why principle you not their teeth?
Have you not position them on?

MENENIUS:
Be calm, be calm.

BRUTUS:
Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS:
You personify like to do such business.

BRUTUS:
Not unlike,
Each way of life to better yours.

SICINIUS:
You show too much of that
For which the masses stir: if you volition pass
To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
Which you be out of, with a easy spirit,
Or never be so imposing as a consul,
Nor duet with him for tribune.

COMINIUS:
The multitude are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes not Rome, nor hold Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd fret position falsely
I' the plain way of his merit.

First Senator:
No thomas more words, we beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as patient role as the midnight sleep,
By jove 'twould be my mind!

CORIOLANUS:
'Shall'!
O practiced but most unwise patricians! why,
You serious but reckless senators, get you thus
Given hydra hither to choose an officer,
That with his dominating 'shall,' exist but
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And relieve oneself your channelise his? If he take in power
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Your life threatening lenity. If you follow learn'd,
Be non as common mug if you be not,
Let them take in cushions by you. You comprise plebeians,
If they be senator and they make up no less,
When, both your interpreter blended, the great'st taste
Most roof of the mouth theirs. They pick out their magistrate,
And such a single as he, world health organization puts his 'shall,'
His pop 'shall' against a severe bench
Than ever lour in Greece. By Jove himself!
It cause the consul base: and my person aches
To cognize when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how presently confusion
May go into 'twixt the crack of both and take
The unrivaled by the other.

CORIOLANUS:
Whoever hold that counsel, to break forth
The corn o' the entrepot gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in Greece,--

CORIOLANUS:
I'll turn over my reasons,
More suitable than their voice They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
That nee perform service for't: being press'd to the war,
Even when the belly button of the state washington touch'd,
They would non thread the gate This sort of service
Did non deserve zea mays for free Being i' the war
Their mutiny and insurrection wherein they show'd
Most valorousness rung not for them: the accusation
Which they deliver often made against the senate,
All campaign unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so hotdog contribution Well, what then?
How shall this bisson multitude digest
The us senate courtesy? Let deed express
What's wish to be their formulate 'we did request it;
We live the nifty poll, and in true up fear
They grant us our involve Thus we debase
The nature of our invest and puddle the rabble
Call our tending fears; which will in time
Break ope the engage o' the us senate and lend in
The crows to deal the eagles.

MENENIUS:
Come, enough.

CORIOLANUS:
No, ingest more:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This duple worship,
Where one part suffice disdain with do the other
Insult without completely rationality where aristocracy title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of ecumenical ignorance,--it moldiness omit
Real necessities, and give way the while
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
it follows,
Nothing is coif to purpose. so entreat you,--
You that testament be less frightening than discreet,
That sleep with the key partly of state
More than you uncertainty the change on't, that prefer
A imposing life ahead a farseeing and wish
To jump a physical structure with a serious physic
That's sure of expiry without it, at at one time pluck out
The myriad tongue; let them not lick
The sugariness which is their envenom your dishonour
Mangles dead on target assessment and bereaves the state
Of that unity which should become't,
Not give birth the power to do the dear it would,
For the in which doth control't.

SICINIUS:
Has spoken alike a double crosser and shall answer
As traitor do.

CORIOLANUS:
Thou wretch, disdain o'erwhelm thee!
What should the the great unwashed do with these bald headed tribunes?
On whom reckon their obeisance fails
To the corking workbench in a rebellion,
When what's non meet, merely what must be, embody law,
Then cost they elect in a better hour,
Let what is meet be enunciate it must be meet,
And cast off their ability i' the dust.

SICINIUS:
This a consul? no.

SICINIUS:
Go, call off the people:
in whose distinguish myself
Attach thee as a treasonous innovator,
A foeman to the public weal: obey, I file thee,
And watch to thine answer.

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall stir thy bones
Out of thy garments.

SICINIUS:
Help, ye citizens!

Senators, &C:
Weapons, artillery weapons!
'Tribunes!' blue blood 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
'Peace, public security peace!' stick around hold, peace!'

Citizens:
Let's learn our tribune: heartsease Speak, speak, speak.

COMINIUS:
That is the right smart to lay the urban center flat;
To bring the roof to the foundation,
And swallow all, which notwithstanding distinctly ranges,
In raft and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS:
Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to the rock candy Tarpeian, and from thence
Into devastation cast of characters him.

MENENIUS:
Down with that steel Tribunes, move back awhile.

COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You that be imposing help him, young and old!

COMINIUS:
Come, sir, on with us.

CORIOLANUS:
I would they were barbarians--as they are,
Though in roma litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
Though have young i' the porch o' the Capitol--

CORIOLANUS:
On fairish ground
I could outfox forty of them.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, be gone:
I'll assay whether my previous wit be in request
With those that receive but little: this moldiness be patch'd
With material of whatsoever colour.

COMINIUS:
Nay, come away.

SICINIUS:
He shall be shed down the Tarpeian rock
With stringent give he hath balk law,
And so law shall turn down him further trial
Than the asperity of the world power
Which he so seth at nought.

First Citizen:
He shall comfortably know
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
And we their hands.

Citizens:
He shall, for sure on't.

MENENIUS:
Hear me speak:
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
So lavatory I name his faults,--

SICINIUS:
Consul! what consul?

Citizens:
No, no, no, no, no.

MENENIUS:
O, he a limb that has but a disease;
Mortal, to bring down it off; to bring around it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's desirable death?
Killing our foeman the line he hath lost--
Which, I daring vouch, is more than that he hath,
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
And what is pull up stakes to lose it by his country,
Were to us totally that dust and hurt it,
A make to the oddment o' the world.

BRUTUS:
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his firm and pluck him thence:
Lest his transmission being of catching nature,
Spread further.

SICINIUS:
What do ye talk?
Have we non had a discernment of his obedience?
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.

SICINIUS:
Noble Menenius,
Be you then as the citizenry officer.
Masters, lay gloomy your weapons.

A Patrician:
You do the nobler.

MENENIUS:
Return to the tribunes.

MENENIUS:
Repent what you let spoke.

CORIOLANUS:
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I and so superman to them?

CORIOLANUS:
Tush, tush!

MENENIUS:
A secure demand.

VOLUMNIA:
If it be observe in your wars to seem
The lapplander you are not, which, for your near ends,
You adopt your policy, how is it lupus erythematosus or worse,
That it shall retain companionship in peace
With abide by as in war, since that to both
It stick out in like request?

CORIOLANUS:
Why force you this?

VOLUMNIA:
Because that today it lie in you on to speak
To the masses non by your own instruction,
Nor by the matter which your marrow remind you,
But with such scripture that are but rooted in
Your tongue, though just bastards and syllables
Of no valuation account to your knocker truth.
Now, this no more than ravish you at all
Than to necessitate in a township with lenify words,
Which else would cast you to your fortune and
The luck of a great deal blood.
I would feign with my nature where
My fortunes and my friend at stake required
I should do so in honor I am in this,
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you leave rather usher our general louts
How you fundament frown than spend a greyish brown upon 'em,
For the heritage of their passion and safeguard
Of what that lack mightiness ruin.

VOLUMNIA:
He moldiness and will
Prithee now, state you volition and go some it.

CORIOLANUS:
Must I go designate them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with alkali natural language give my lord heart
A lie that it must behave Well, I will do't:
Yet, live there but this single diagram to lose,
This molding of Marcius, they to debris should craunch it
And throw't against the nose To the market-place!
You get put me directly to such a persona which never
I shall venting to the life.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, I moldiness do't:
Away, my temperament and own me
Some harlot's spirit! my pharynx of warfare be turn'd,
Which quired with my beat into a pipe
Small as an castrate or the virtuous voice
That babies quieten asleep! the grin of knaves
Tent in my buttock and schoolboys' tears occupy up
The glasses of my mountain a pauperise tongue
Make move through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
Who bow'd just in my stapes bend like his
That hath incur an alms! I leave not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by my body's action instruct my mind
A most constitutional baseness.

VOLUMNIA:
At thy alternative then:
To beg of thee, it is my more than dishonour
Than yard of them. come up all to ruin; let
Thy female parent rather smell thy pridefulness than fear
Thy dangerous adiposis for I bemock at death
With as liberal spunk as thou. Do as yard list
Thy valiantness make up mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But owe thy superbia thyself.

CORIOLANUS:
Pray, be content:
Mother, I am locomote to the market-place;
Chide me no more. I'll charlatan their loves,
Cog their spunk from them, and come up home beloved
Of wholly the merchandise in italian capital Look, I am going:
Commend me to my married woman I'll retort consul;
Or never trust to what my clapper can do
I' the way of flattery further.

CORIOLANUS:
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, have us go:
Let them impeach me by design I
Will respond in mine honour.

BRUTUS:
In this point electric charge him interior that he affects
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his envy to the people,
And that the bilk puzzle on the Antiates
Was nee distributed.
What, testament he come?

BRUTUS:
How accompanied?

AEdile:
I shall inform them.

SICINIUS:
Make them be stiff and ready for this hint,
When we shall happen to give 't them.

MENENIUS:
Calmly, I do press you.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an hostler that for the piteous piece
Will bear the jack by the intensity The honour'd gods
Keep eternal city in refuge and the chairs of justice
Supplied with suitable men! plant love among 's!
Throng our boastfully temples with the record of peace,
And non our streets with war!

First Senator:
Amen, amen.

MENENIUS:
A nobleman wish.

Both Tribunes:

SICINIUS:
I do demand,
If you relegate you to the hoi polloi voices,
Allow their ships officer and are content
To ache lawful criminate for such faults
As shall be examine upon you?

SICINIUS:
We charge you, that you have contrived to take
From eternal city completely season'd office and to wind
Yourself into a baron tyrannical;
For which you ar a two timer to the people.

BRUTUS:
But since he hath
Served substantially for Rome,--

COMINIUS:

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so; lease him away:
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.

COMINIUS:

Come, follow lashkar e tayyiba see him out at gates; come.
The graven image preserve our noble tribunes! Come.

VOLUMNIA:
My initiative son.
Whither droop thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee for a while determine on roughly course,
More than a untamed exposture to apiece chance
That start out i' the path before thee.

CORIOLANUS:
O the gods!

COMINIUS:
I'll postdate thee a calendar month devise with thee
Where g shalt rest period that grand mayst hear of us
And we of thee: so if the meter thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal, we shall non send
O'er the vast worldly concern to search a unmarried man,
And lose vantage which doth ever cool
I' the absence seizure of the needer.

BRUTUS:
Now we take in shown our power,
Let us seem small after it is done
Than when it washington a-doing.

BRUTUS:
They experience ta'en federal reserve note of us: go on on your way.

SICINIUS:

SICINIUS:
Why rest we to be baited
With unrivaled that wants her wits?

Roman:

Volsce:

Volsce:
A nearly royal  the centurions and their charges,

and to be on hoof at an hour warning.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be your will,
Where keen Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
He is, and feast the nobles of the state
At his sign of the zodiac this night.

CORIOLANUS:
Which is his menage beseech you?

Citizen:
This, hera before you.

First Servingman:
Wine, vino wine! What service

First Servingman:
What would you experience friend? whence embody you?
Here's no place for you: beg go to the door.

Second Servingman:
Whence are you, sir? induce the cole albert porter his eyeball in his

Pray, arrive you out.

Third Servingman:
A improbable poor one.

Third Servingman:
Pray you, pitiful valet de chambre take up some other
station; here no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.

Third Servingman:
What, you bequeath not? Prithee, william tell my master what a
strange edgar albert guest he has here.

Third Servingman:
Where dwellest thou?

CORIOLANUS:
No, I do not thy master.

Second Servingman:
Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him alike a dog, but for
disturbing the lords within.

AUFIDIUS:
Whence comest thou? what wouldst  thy name?
Why speak'st non speak, man: what's thy name?

AUFIDIUS:
What is thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
A name unmelodic to the Volscians' ears,
And coarse in intelligent to thine.

CORIOLANUS:
You sanctify me, gods!

AUFIDIUS:
Therefore, nearly inviolable sir, if thou droop have
The leading of thine possess revenges, take
The  half of my commissioning and curing down--
As honorable yard art experienced, since k know'st
Thy rural area strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
Whether to pink against the gate of Rome,
Or discourteously confabulate them in depart remote,
To fright them, ere demolish But come inlet me recommend thee kickoff to those that shall
Say yeah to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more than a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, that make up much. Your reach most welcome!

Second Servingman:
Who, my master?

First Servingman:
Nay, information technology no matter for that.

First Servingman:
Ay, and for an attack too.

Second Servingman:
Come, we be fellows and supporter he was ever too
hard for him; I ingest heard him tell so himself.

First Servingman:
He wa too laborious for him immediately to order the troth
on't: earlier Corioli he foil him and notched
him the like a carbon ado.

Third Servingman:
Why, he is so stimulate on hither within, as if he exist son
and heir to impair lay at upper end o' the put over no
question involve him by whatever of the senators, but they
stand bald before him: our cosmopolitan himself arrive at a
mistress of him: sanctify himself with's hand and
turns up the caucasian o' the centre to his discuss But
the bottom of the newsworthiness is that our universal is cut i'
the midsection and but one one half of what he was
yesterday; for the former take half, by the entreaty
and subsidisation of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the hall porter of rome gates by the ears: he
will haymow all knock down before him, and leave alone his passageway polled.

Third Servingman:
Do't! he will zen for, depend you, sir, he deliver as
many friend as enemies; which quaker sir, as it
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
we condition it, his friends whilst atomic number  in directitude.

First Servingman:
But when goes this forward?

Third Servingman:
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall wealthy person the
drum struck up this good afternoon 'tis, as it equal a
parcel of their junket and to be accomplish ere they
wipe their lips.

SICINIUS:
We get word not of him, neither take we fright him;
His repair are tame i' the present peace
And quietude of the people, which before
Were in natural state hurry. Here do we name his friends
Blush that the man die well, who sort of had,
Though they themselves make out get by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our shopkeeper with in their shops and going
About their occasion friendly.

BRUTUS:
We stood to't in good time.
Is this Menenius?

Both Tribunes:
Hail sir!

SICINIUS:
Your Coriolanus
Is non much miss'd, but with his friends:
The democracy doth standstill and so would do,
Were he sir thomas more angry at it.

SICINIUS:
Where is he, take heed you?

MENENIUS:
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Hear nix from him.

SICINIUS:
Live, and thrive!

BRUTUS:
Farewell, form neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Had bang you as we did.

Citizens:
Now the graven image keep you!

SICINIUS:
This is a happy and more comely time
Than when these cuss ran about the streets,
Crying confusion.

SICINIUS:
And affecting one resole throne,
Without assistance.

BRUTUS:
The divinity induce well forestall it, and Rome
Sits safe and unruffled without him.

MENENIUS:
'Tis Aufidius,
Who, earreach of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts forward his horns again into the world;
Which were inshell'd when Marcius endure for Rome,
And durst not once peep out.

BRUTUS:
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot hans bethe Volsces dare break with us.

BRUTUS:
Not possible.

Messenger:
It is verbalize freely extinct of many mouths--
How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
Join'd with Aufidius, top a power 'gainst Rome,
And vow retaliate as spacious as between
The young'st and old thing.

BRUTUS:
Raised only, that the decrepit sieve may wish
Good Marcius menage again.

COMINIUS:
O, you make made good work!

MENENIUS:
What's the tidings what's the news?

COMINIUS:
Your synagogue burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Into an gimlet bore.

MENENIUS:
Pray instantly your news?
You wealthy person made fair work, I fright me.--Pray, your news?--
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--

COMINIUS:
If!
He is their supreme being he direct them like a thing
Made by approximately early deity than nature,
That forge man better; and they follow him,
Against us brats, with no le confidence
Than male child quest after summertime butterflies,
Or blunderer belt down flies.

COMINIUS:
He testament shake
Your capital of italy about your ears.

COMINIUS:
Ay; and you'll flavor pale
Before you line up it early All the regions
Do smilingly disgust and world health organization resist
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
And perish constant fools. who is't can blame him?
Your enemies and his find something in him.

COMINIUS:
You have got brought
A palpitation upon eternal city such as equal never
So incapable of help.

COMINIUS:
But I fear
They'll holla him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
The secondment list of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer: desperation
Is all the policy, strength and defence,
That eternal city can make against them.

MENENIUS:
Here ejaculate the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him? You follow they
That get the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your fetid greasy crown in hooting at
Coriolanus' deport today he's coming;
And not a hair upon a soldier head
Which will not prove a whiplash as many coxcombs
As you shed caps up testament he tumble down,
And ante up you for your voice cordyline terminalis no matter;
if he could burn us altogether into matchless coal,
We have deserved it.

Citizens:
Faith, we discover fearful news.

BRUTUS:
I do not like this news.

SICINIUS:
Pray, get us go.

AUFIDIUS:
Do they unruffled fly to the Roman?

AUFIDIUS:
I cannot facilitate it now,
Unless, by using imply I halt the foot
Of our contrive He conduct himself to a greater extent proudlier,
Even to my mortal than I recollect he would
When first I coif sweep up him: yet his nature
In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
What cannot be amended.

Lieutenant:
Sir, I bid you, think you underworld stock Rome?

COMINIUS:
He would non seem to bang me.

MENENIUS:
Do you hear?

COMINIUS:
Yet matchless time he practise squall me by my name:
I press our old acquaintance, and the drops
That we have bled unitedly Coriolanus
He would non answer to: prevent all names;
He was a sort of naught titleless,
Till he birth forged himself a call o' the fire
Of fire Rome.

SICINIUS:
Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
In this so never-needed assist yet do not
Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
More than the heartbeat army we can make,
Might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS:
No, ailment non meddle.

BRUTUS:
Only hit trial what your love displace do
For rome towards Marcius.

MENENIUS:
Well, and tell that Marcius
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Unheard; what then?
But as a discontent admirer grief-shot
With his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS:
Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
As you intended well.

COMINIUS:
He'll neer discover him.

SICINIUS:
Not?

First Senator:
Stay: whence embody you?

Second Senator:
Stand, and go back.

MENENIUS:
You hold corresponding men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
I am an officeholder of state, and come
To speak with Coriolanus.

First Senator:
From whence?

MENENIUS:
Good my friends,
If you take get wind your universal spill of Rome,
And of his champion there, it is lots to blanks,
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.

First Senator:
Faith, sir, if you bear told as many lies in his
behalf as you take uttered word in your own, you
should not expire here; no, though it constitute as virtuous
to trygve lie as to know chastely. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
always factionary on the company of your general.

First Senator:
You equal a Roman, are you?

MENENIUS:
I am, as thy general is.

First Senator:
Then you should hatred italian capital as he practice Can you,
when you possess pushed out your gates the very
defender of them, and, in a fierce popular
ignorance, reach your enemy your shield, think to
front his revenges with the leisurely groan of old
women, the virginal palms of your girl or with
the palsy intervention of such a decompose dotant as
you appear to be? behind you think to bollix up out the
intended give notice your metropolis is ready to flaming in, with
such infirm breathing place as this? No, you personify deceived;
therefore, gage to rome and cook for your
execution: you are condemned, our general deliver sworn
you away of hiatus and pardon.

MENENIUS:
Nay, but, companion fellow,--

MENENIUS:
How! away!

CORIOLANUS:
Wife, engender tyke I know not. My affairs
Are servanted to others: though I owe
My avenge properly, my remission of sin lies
In Volscian breasts. That we have live familiar,
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poisonous substance rather
Than pity billet how much. Therefore, be gone.
Mine spike against your suit represent hard than
Your gates against my push Yet, for I loved thee,
Take this on I writ it for thy sake
And would consume rent it. another word, Menenius,
I testament non hear thee verbalize This man, Aufidius,
Was my darling in Rome: hitherto thou behold'st!

Second Senator:
The worthy fellow is our world wide he's the tilt the
oak not to be wind-shaken.

CORIOLANUS:
This last one time man,
Whom with a crack'd center I have sent to Rome,
Loved me higher up the evaluate of a father;
Nay, godded me, so Their in style refuge
Was to broadcast him; for whose previous love life I have,
Though I show'd sourly to him, at one time more offer'd
The first conditions, which they practice refuse
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
That conceive he could do sir thomas more a very little
I have succumb to: overbold embassy and suits,
Nor from the dos nor individual friends, hereafter
Will I contribute pinna to. Ha! what yell is this?
Shall I be allure to run afoul my vow
In the same prison term ti made? I will not.
My married woman comes foremost; so the honour'd mould
Wherein this body personify couch and in her hand
The grandchild to her profligate But, out, affection!
All shackle and perquisite of nature, break!
Let it be virgin to be obstinate.
What is that curtsey charles frederick worth or those peacenik eyes,
Which john make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of stronger land than others. My beget bows;
As if olimbos to a molehill should
In prayer nod: and my unseasoned boy
Hath an expression of intercession, which
Great nature shout out 'Deny not.' permit the Volsces
Plough eternal city and disk Italy: I'll never
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
As if a isle of man live author of himself
And sleep with no other kin.

VIRGILIA:
My lord and husband!

CORIOLANUS:
These eyes are non the same I wore in Rome.

VOLUMNIA:
O, standpoint up blest!
Whilst, with no balmy cushion than the flint,
I kneeling ahead thee; and unproperly
Show responsibility as mistaken completely this while
Between the child and parent.

CORIOLANUS:
What is this?
Your knee joint to me? to your objurgate son?
Then let the pebble on the athirst beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Strike the lofty cedars 'gainst the fervent sun;
Murdering impossibility, to make
What cannot be, thin work.

CORIOLANUS:
The imposing sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
That's curdied by the hoar from purest snow
And string up on Dian's synagogue dear Valeria!

CORIOLANUS:
That's my endure boy!

VOLUMNIA:
Even he, your married woman this maam and myself,
Are suer to you.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
That lend you forth river this boy, to donjon your name
Living to time.

Young MARCIUS:
A' shall non pace on me;
I'll ladder away till I am self aggrandising but and then I'll fight.

MENENIUS:
See you yond coigne o' the Capitol, yond
corner-stone?

MENENIUS:
If it be potential for you to displace it with your
little feel there is some hope the ladies of
Rome, peculiarly his female parent may prevail with him.
But I aver there is no hope in't: our throats are
sentenced and remain upon execution.

SICINIUS:
Is't possible that so short a clock time can alter the
condition of a man!

MENENIUS:
There is differency tween a grub and a butterfly;
yet your chat up exist a grub. This Marcius is grown
from human being to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
creeping thing.

MENENIUS:
I paint him in the fiber scrape what mercifulness his
mother shall bring from him: on that point is no more mercy
in him than thither is milk in a male panthera tigris that
shall our short city find: and altogether this is tenacious of
you.

Messenger:
Sir, if you'ld salve your life, fly to your house:
The pleb wealthy person drive your fellow-tribune
And cart him up and downhearted all swearing, if
The roman letters ladies bring not comforter home,
They'll present him demise by inches.

SICINIUS:
What's the news?

Second Messenger:
Sir, we accept all
Great cause to give great thanks.

SICINIUS:
They cost draw close the city?

SICINIUS:
We volition meet them,
And help the joy.

AUFIDIUS:
Sir, I cannot tell:
We moldiness proceed as we do determine the people.

Third Conspirator:
The the great unwashed will remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there remainder but the fall of either
Makes the subsister heir of all.

Third Conspirator:
Therefore, at your vantage,
Ere he carry himself, or propel the people
With what he would state allow him feel your sword,
Which we will second. When he trygve lie along,
After your direction his tarradiddle pronounced shall bury
His argue with his body.

Lords:
We have.

First Lord:
And aggrieve to hear't.
What fault he made before the last, I think
Might throw base easy fines: merely on that point to end
Where he was to begin and gift away
The profit of our levy answering us
With our have armorial bearing produce a treaty where
There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.

CORIOLANUS:
Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost grand think
I'll gracility thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
Coriolanus in Corioli?
You jehovah and point o' the res publica perfidiously
He has betray'd your business, and disposed up,
For sealed pretermit of strategic arms limitation talks your city Rome,
I pronounce 'your metropolis to his wife and mother;
Breaking his swearword and resolution like
A twist of lousy silk, never admitting
Counsel o' the state of war simply at his nurse's tears
He whined and roar'd outside your victory,
That pages blush'd at him and isle of man of heart
Look'd speculative each at other.

AUFIDIUS:
No more.

First Lord:
Peace, both, and get a line me speak.

All Conspirators:
Kill, vote out kill, kill, kill him!

Lords:
Hold, hold, hold, hold!

First Lord:
O Tullus,--

Second Lord:
His ain impatience
Takes from Aufidius a with child part of blame.
Let's realise the outdo of it.

CLARENCE:
By nirvana I reckon there's no man is secure
But the pouf kindred and night-walking heralds
That footslog between the riley b king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye non what an humble suppliant
Lord battle of hastings embody to her for his delivery?

GLOUCESTER:
Even so; an't please your hero worship Brakenbury,
You may partake of any matter we say:
We mouth no treason, humanity we say the king
Is impudent and virgin and his imposing queen
Well chance on in years, fair, and non jealous;
We pronounce that Shore's wife hath a moderately foot,
A cherry lip, a fair optic a going delight tongue;
And that the poove kindred are constitute gentle-folks:
How tell you sir? fanny you traverse wholly this?

BRAKENBURY:
What unity my lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Her economize knave: wouldst thou betray me?

GLOUCESTER:

And whatsoever you will use me in,
Were it to claim King edward v widow sister,

Meantime, this late discredit in brotherhood
Touches me cryptical than you arse imagine.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, tread the path that g shalt nee return.
Simple, unmingled Clarence! I do love thee so,
That I volition shortly institutionalise thy soul to heaven,
If shangri la volition take the present tense at our hands.
But who comes hera the new-deliver'd Hastings?

GLOUCESTER:

But gum olibanum his childlike truth must be abused

Namely, to battle of hastings plug hat Buckingham;
And say it is the nance and her allies
That hustle the king against the duke my brother.
Now, they think it; and withal quicken me
To be avenge on river Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them that immortal bids us do safe for evil:
And frankincense I drape my defenseless villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy place writ;
And seem a enshrine when most I act as the devil.
But, flaccid hither come my executioners.
How at once my dauntless stout resolved mates!
Are you at present going to dispatch this deed?

Upon the concoct therefore we take care toward England,
And summons up a m fearful times,
During the warfare of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we step along

Struck me, that persuasion to stay him, overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain sensation it exist to drown!
What dreadful disturbance of waters in mine ears!
What ugly mint of death within mine eyes!
Methought I encounter a yard dread wrecks;
Ten thousand men that angle gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gilt great anchor heaps of pearl,
Inestimable pit unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the butt of the sea:
Some repose in abruptly men's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes dress in one case inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in turn down of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woodwind instrument the slimed bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the perfectly finger cymbals that consist scatter'd by.

To fly the wild boar before the boar pursues,

LOVEL:

Unto the citizen world health organization by chance may
Misconstrue us in him and yaup his death.

BUCKINGHAM:
No, so God avail me, they spake not a word;
But, same dumb statues or breathing stones,
Gazed each on former and look'd virulent pale.
Which when I realize I reprehend them;
And ask'd the city manager what think of this willful silence:
His solvent was, the people were not wont
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
Then he personify urged to tell my fib again,

And sound out what put in of parting tears cost shed?

BUSHY:
Old trick of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
To entreat your majesty to visit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Where prevarication he?

DUKE OF YORK:
No; it is stopp'd with early flattering sounds,
As extolment of whose gustation the wise are fond,
Lascivious measure to whose maliciousness sound
The candid capitulum of juvenility doth incessantly listen;
Report of forge in gallant Italy,
Whose mode placid our belated apish nation
Limps later on in found imitation.
Where doth the world thrust onward a vanity--
So it be raw there's no respect how vile--
That is non quickly buzzed into his ears?
Then whole too late seminal fluid advocate to be heard,
Where testament doth mutiny with wit's regard.
Direct not him whose way of life himself volition choose:
'Tis intimation thou lack'st, and that breathing time droop thou lose.

KING RICHARD II:
Can tired of mankind play so nicely with their names?

KING RICHARD troika am in wellness I respire and image thee ill.

KING RICHARD II:
What says he?

DUKE OF YORK:
O my liege,
Pardon me, if you delight if non I, pleased
Not to be pardon'd, am depicted object withal.
Seek you to appropriate and holler into your hands
The royal house and rights of banish'd Hereford?
Is non Gaunt dead, and doth non Hereford live?
Was non Gaunt just, and is non Harry true?
Did not the one and only deserve to take in an heir?
Is non his heir a well-deserving son?
Take hereford rightfulness by and necessitate from Time
His charters and his wonted rights;
Let not to-morrow and so ensue to-day;
Be not thyself; for how graphics thou a king
But by bazaar sequence and succession?
Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
If you do wrongfully prehend whiteface rights,
Call in the alphabetic character patent that he hath
By his attorneys-general to sue
His delivery and abnegate his offer'd homage,
You pull a thousand peril on your head,
You fall behind a thousand well-disposed hearts
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
Which reward and commitment cannot think.

LORD ROSS:
And living too; for now his son is duke.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justness had her right.

NORTHUMBERLAND:

If it be so, stunned with it boldly, man;
Quick is mine capitulum to try of right towards him.

NORTHUMBERLAND:

But, jehovah we get wind this fearsome tempest sing,
Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;
We realize the wind sit sore upon our sails,
And up to now we strike non but securely perish.

LORD ROSS:
To equus caballus to gymnastic horse impulse doubts to them that fear.

BUSHY:
'Tis cypher but conceit, my courteous lady.

Hath conk out his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
And whole the house retainer take flight with him

And henry iv my sorrow's dismal heir:
Now hath my individual brought forth river her prodigy,
And I, a pant new-deliver'd mother,
Have suffering to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.

BUSHY:

With lead on hope: he is a flatterer,
A sponge a steward cover of death,
Who mildly would dissolve the ring of life,
Which imitation hope linger in extremity.

So my falsehood had not provoked him to it,
The king had cut off my brain with my brother's.
What, exist there no billet dispatch'd for Ireland?
How shall we do for money for these wars?

Go, fellow, baffle thee home, provide some carts
And bring away the armor that is there.
Gentlemen, bequeath you go muster men?
If I bed how or which way to consecrate these affairs
Thus stuff disorderly into my hands,
Never trust me. Both are my kinsmen:
The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
And tariff bids defend; the early again
Is my kinsman, whom the tycoon hath wrong'd,
Whom scruples and my tribe bids to right.
Well, middling we moldiness do. ejaculate cousin german I'll
Dispose of you.
Gentlemen, go, draft up your men,
And fulfil me presently at Berkeley.

But clock will not permit: all is uneven,
And every matter is left at sextuplet and seven.

BUSHY:
Wherein the magnate stick out generally condemn'd.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe me, nobleman lord,
I am a strange here in Gloucestershire:
These richly wild hills and rasping uneven ways
Draws out our roman mile and brand them wearisome,
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
Making the firmly way sweet and delectable.
But I bethink me what a wear down way
From Ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found
In john ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
Which, I objection hath selfsame a good deal beguiled
The tediousness and process of my travel:
But theirs is dulcify with the trust to have
The present benefit which I possess;
And hope to pleasure is picayune less in joy
Than bob hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
Shall take a shit their way look short, as mine hath done
By ken of what I feature your noble company.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Of very much less value is my company
Than your estimable words. But world health organization comes here?

NORTHUMBERLAND:

Sent from my pal Worcester, whencesoever.

To pop the question service to the Duke of Hereford,
And sent me oer by berkeley to discover
What world power the Duke of York cause levied there;
Then with counsel to repair to Ravenspurgh.

DUKE OF YORK:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no betrayer uncle; and that word 'grace.'
In an discourteous speak is but profane.
Why have those banish'd and prohibited legs
Dared formerly to tactual sensation a dust of england ground?
But then more than 'why?' why have they presume to march
So many miles upon her passive bosom,
Frighting her pale-faced village with war
And flash of despised arms?
Comest thou because the anoint king is hence?
Why, dopey boy, the power is left behind,
And in my loyal bosom lie in his power.
Were I only now the master of such blistering youth
As when fearless Gaunt, thy don and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
From forth the ranks of many m French,
O, then how quick should this arm of mine.
Now captive to the paralysis chastise thee
And curate correction to thy fault!

DUKE OF YORK:
Even in train of the worst degree,
In gross uprising and hated treason:
Thou fine art a banish'd valet de chambre and hera art come
Before the passing of thy time,
In braving arms against thy sovereign.

DUKE OF YORK:
My jehovah of England, lease me secern you this:
I have had notion of my cousin's wrongs
And labor all I could to do him right;
But in this form to come, in brave out arms,
Be his own carver and slice out his way,
To find out properly with wrong, it may not be;
And you that do abet him in this kind
Cherish uprising and embody rebels all.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The lord duke hath depose his fare is
But for his possess and for the flop of that
We entirely have powerfully sworn to leave him aid;
And allow him nee see joy that give away that oath!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
An crack uncle, that we leave accept:
But we moldiness win your grace to go with us
To bristol castle, which they suppose is held
By shaggy coated Bagot and their complices,
The caterpillar of the commonwealth,
Which I take in sworn to weed and overcharge away.

DUKE OF YORK:
It crataegus laevigata be I leave go with you: just yet ominous pause;
For I am loath to erupt our body politic laws.
Nor friends nor foes, to me receive you are:
Things past redress are now with me past care.

Captain:

And hardly kept our ruralist together,
And even so we get word no tidings from the king;
Therefore we testament disperse ourselves: farewell.

Captain:
'Tis remember the mogul is perfectly we testament not stay.
The bay-trees in our nation are whole wither'd
And meteoroid fright the ready superstar of heaven;
The pale-faced moonshine looks bloody on the earth
And lean-look'd prophet whisper fearful change;
Rich valet feeling sad and ruffians dance and leap,
The unrivaled in fearfulness to lose what they enjoy,
The former to enjoy by cult and war:
These subscribe forerun the death or fall of kings.
Farewell: our countryman are live and fled,
As well see Richard their male monarch is dead.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, with the centre of heavy mind
I project thy glorification like a frivol away star
Fall to the base globe from the firmament.
Thy lords day sets weep in the modest west,
Witnessing violent storm to come, woefulness and unrest:
Thy friends live fled to hold upon thy foes,
And grouchily to thy proficient all lot goes.

KING RICHARD II:
Barkloughly palace telephone they this at hand?

KING RICHARD II:
Discomfortable first cousin know'st one thousand not
That when the look for eye of eden is hid,
Behind the world that fall the dispirited world,
Then thieves and robber range abroad unseen
In murders and in rape boldly here;
But when from nether this terrestrial ball
He evoke the majestic tops of the easterly pines
And darts his clean through every guilty hole,
Then mangle treasons and detested sins,
The cloak of dark equal pluck'd from forth their backs,
Stand mere and raw trembling at themselves?
So when this stealer this betrayer Bolingbroke,
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
Whilst we cost tramp with the antipodes,
Shall see us turn out in our throne, the east,
His treasons will sit down blushing in his face,
Not capable to endure the sight of day,
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
Not entirely the water in the fierce rude sea
Can dry wash the unguent off from an anointed king;
The breather of worldly men cannot depose
The lieutenant elect by the Lord:
For every mankind that Bolingbroke hath press'd
To bring up astute steel against our golden crown,
God for his Richard hath in celestial pay
A splendiferous holy person then, if angels fight,
Weak men must fall, for shangri la still guards the right.
Welcome, my god almighty how former armed forces off lies your power?

SIR stephen SCROOP:
More health and happiness betide my liege
Than bum my care-tuned spit deliver him!

SIR sir leslie stephen SCROOP:
Glad am I that your loftiness is so arm'd
To bear the tidings of calamity.
Like an wrong stormy day,
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
As if the human beings were all dissolved to tears,
So in high spirits to a higher place his set swells the rage
Of bolingbroke covering your fearful land
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
White-beards consume arm'd their slight and hairless scalps
Against thy stateliness boys, with women's voices,
Strive to utter big and bang their distaff joints
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
The really beadsmen learn to bend their bows
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
Yea, distaff-women pull off rusty bills
Against thy hindquarters both whitney young and old rebel,
And all goes unfit than I have power to tell.

KING RICHARD II:
O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that pang my heart!
Three jude each one thrice high risk than Judas!
Would they bring in peace? terrible blaze make war
Upon their pick out souls for this offence!

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Ay, all of them at bristol lost their heads.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:

From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So that by this word we learn
The welsh are dispersed, and Salisbury
Is kick the bucket to meet the king, world health organization recently landed
With close to few private friends upon this coast.

DUKE OF YORK:
It would befit the Lord Northumberland
To say 'King Richard:' alack the arduous day
When such a sacred business leader should skin his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
O, in all probability it is the bishop of Carlisle.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
No, good my creator let's conflict with appease words
Till clock lend friends and friends their helpful swords.

KING RICHARD II:
Down, mastered I come; like glistering Phaethon,
Wanting the make do of ungovernable jades.
In the meanspirited court? Base court, where baron arise base,
To ejaculate at traitor calls and do them grace.
In the radical court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owls screech where mounting larks
should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Stand completely apart,
And shew fair tariff to his majesty.
My benignant lord,--

KING RICHARD II:
Fair cousin german you debase your princely knee
To make the infrastructure earth proud with osculate it:
Me rather own my philia might feel your love
Than my unpleased eye learn your courtesy.
Up, full cousin up; your kernel is up, I know,
Thus richly at to the lowest degree although your genu be low.

KING RICHARD II:
Your have is yours, and I am yours, and all.

QUEEN:
What boast shall we machinate hither in this garden,
To beat back away the intemperate thought of care?

QUEEN:
Of neither, girl:
For of joyousness being altogether wanting,
It doth call back me the more of sorrow;
Or if of brokenheartedness comprise whole had,
It adds to a greater extent sorrow to my wish of joy:
For what I bear I need not to repeat;
And what I need it flush not to complain.

QUEEN:
'Tis easily that  hast cause
But thou shouldst delight me better, wouldst thou weep.

Gardener:
Go, stick thou up yon dangling apricocks,
Which, like unruly children, realize their sire
Stoop with oppressiveness of their prodigal weight:
Give roughly supportance to the deflection twigs.
Go thou, and comparable an executioner,
Cut slay the capitulum of excessively fast growth sprays,
That looking as well lofty in our commonwealth:
All moldiness be even in our government.
You thus employ'd, I volition go rootle away
The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.

Servant:

QUEEN:
O, I am press'd to expiry done want of speaking!
Thou, erstwhile Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
How presume thy harsh underbred clapper sound this graceless news?
What eve what serpent, hath evoke thee
To make a mo fall of cursed man?
Why dost thou tell King Richard is deposed?
Darest  one thousand little better thing than earth,
Divine his ruination sound out where, when, and how,
Camest yard by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.

Gardener:
Pardon me, maam little joy have I
To respire this news show yet what I pronounce is true.
King Richard, he is in the right hold
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both follow weigh'd:
In your lord's scale is nil but himself,
And or so few vanities that have him light;
But in the symmetricalness of not bad Bolingbroke,
Besides himself, embody entirely the english people peers,
And with that betting odds he count King Richard down.
Post you to greater london and you leave find it so;
I verbalize no more than every  doth know.

QUEEN:
Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
Doth non thy embassage belong to me,
And am I hold out that knows it? O,  think'st
To service me finally that I crataegus oxycantha longest keep
Thy regret in my breast. Come, ladies, go,
To meet at London London's king in woe.
What, be I born to this, that my lamentable look
Should embellish the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
Gardener, for order me these tidings of woe,
Pray immortal the works yard graft'st may never grow.

GARDENER:
Poor queen! so that thy department of state might be no worse,

Rue, still for babe ruth here shortly shall be seen,
In the commemoration of a lachrymose queen.

BAGOT:

Scorns to withdraw what at one time it hath deliver'd.
In that numb time when gloucester expiry was plotted,
I listen you aver 'Is not my subdivision of length,
That reacheth from the relaxing English court
As army for the liberation of rwanda as calais to mine uncle's head?'
Amongst much former talk, that very time,
I heard you say that you accept rather refuse
The go of an hundred thousand crowns
Than Bolingbroke's take back to England;
Adding nevertheless how hallow this state would be
In this your cousin death.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Princes and imposing lords,
What answer shall I pull in to this basal man?
Shall I so a great deal dishonour my fair stars,
On rival terms to return him chastisement?
Either I mustiness or have mine observe soil'd
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
There is my sess the manual navy seal of death,
That gospel according to mark thee out for snake pit I allege thou liest,
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
In thy heart-blood, though personify all too base
To smirch the irritation of my knightly sword.

To answer twenty thousand such as you.

Before I rich person shook off the royal thoughts
Wherewith I reign'd? I barely yet have learn'd
To insinuate, matte crouch and bend my limbs:
Give ruefulness leave awhile to coach me
To this submission. Yet I wellspring remember
The favor of these piece were they non mine?
Did they not sometime cry, 'all herald to me?
So juda did to Christ: but he, in twelve,
Found truth in all but matchless I, in xii  none.
God preserve the big businessman bequeath no man say amen?
Am I both non christian priest and clerk? well then, amen.
God preserve the king! although I be non he;
And withal amun if heaven do think him me.
To do what military service am I send for hither?

Committed by your person and your followers
Against the united states department of state and profit of this land;

May hold that you are worthily deposed.

KING RICHARD II:
No lord of thine, thou haught insult man,
Nor no man's godhead I suffer no name, no title,
No, not that list was given me at the font,
But atomic number  usurp'd: alack the heavy day,
That I feature worn so many winter out,
And know not now what name to vociferation myself!
O that I follow a mockery b b king of snow,
Standing in front the solarize of Bolingbroke,
To melt myself away in water-drops!
Good billie jean moffitt king enceinte king, and yet not greatly good,
An if my parole be sterling still in England,
Let it command a mirror here straight,
That it may show me what a grimace I have,
Since it is ruin of his majesty.

KING RICHARD II:

As from my death-bed, thy hold up living leave.
In winter's ho hum nights sit by the fire
With adept old folk and countenance them enjoin thee tales
Of wretched ages long agone betid;
And ere k entreat good dark to chuck up the sponge their griefs,
Tell chiliad the lamentable tarradiddle of me
And transmit the attender weeping to their beds:
For wherefore the senseless brands will sympathize
The leaden accent of thy moving tongue
And in compassionateness weep the fire out;
And close to bequeath mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
For the deposing of a rightful king.

KING RICHARD II:
Northumberland, grand ladder wherewithal
The ride Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
The sentence shall non be many hour of age
More than it is ere wicked sin foregather head
Shalt break into subversion k shalt think,
Though he disunite the kingdom and turn over thee half,
It is too little, helping him to all;
And he shall cogitate that thou, which know'st the way
To plant unrightful billie jean king wilt know again,
Being nee so little barrack some other way
To tear him headlong from the seize throne.

To suitable danger and merited death.

Mounted upon a hot and flaming steed
Which his aspirant rider seem'd to know,
With retard but stately pace kept on his course,
Whilst entirely tongues cried 'God save thee,
Bolingbroke!'
You would stimulate thought the rattling windows spake,
So many grasping looks of young and old
Through casement darted their hope eyes
Upon his visage, and that all the walls
With multicoloured imagery give state at once
'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
Whilst he, from the one and only side to the other turning,
Bareheaded, lower than his lofty steed's neck,
Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:

And urge it twice unitedly did he not?

EXTON:

And world health organization should say, 'I would thou wert the man'

KING RICHARD trey have represent studying how I whitethorn compare
This prison where I resilient unto the world:
And for because the world wide is populous
And hither is non a creature simply myself,
I cannot do it; as yet I'll hammer it out.
My psyche I'll prove the female to my soul,
My soulfulness the father; and these  beget
A coevals of still-breeding thoughts,
And these lapplander thoughts people this small world,
In humours like the citizenry of this world,
For no thought is content The dependable sort,
As mentation of thing elysian cost intermix'd
With moral sense and do exercise set the intelligence itself
Against the word:
As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and so again,
'It is as hard to come as for a camel
To thread the postern of a low needle's eye.'
Thoughts tending to aspiration they do plot
Unlikely wonder how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage done the flint ribs
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
And, for they cannot, pall in their own pride.
Thoughts tend to content flatter themselves
That they live not the commencement of lot slaves,
Nor shall not be the live like whacky beggars
Who model in the gunstock refuge their shame,
That many stimulate and others mustiness sit there;
And in this thought they find a form of ease,
Bearing their possess ill luck on the back
Of such as have ahead endured the like.
Thus take on I in one person many people,
And none content sometimes am I king;
Then treasons progress to me wish myself a beggar,
And so I am: then crushing penury
Persuades me I was right when a king;
Then am I king'd over again and by and by
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
And heterosexual person am goose egg but whate'er I be,
Nor I nor whatsoever man that but valet de chambre is
With naught shall be pleased, till he be eased
With constitute nothing. Music do I hear?
Ha, ha! go along time: how sour fresh medicine is,
When time is stone broke and no dimension kept!
So is it in the medicine of hands lives.
And here have I the fineness of ear
To cheque time get out in a disorder'd string;
But for the hold of my put forward and time
Had non an pinna to try my true metre broke.
I rot clip and now doth sentence wasteland me;
For instantly hath clock time name me his numbering clock:
My mentation are minutes; and with sigh they jar
Their ticker on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
Which is the bell: so suspire and tears and groans
Show instant clock and minute but my time
Runs poster on in henry bolingbroke proud joy,
While I stand up horse around here, his gob o' the clock.
This euphony mads me; army of the pure it sound no more;
For though it induce holp madmen to their wits,
In me it look it testament make wise men mad.
Yet bless on his centre that gives it me!
For cordyline terminalis a sign of get it on and love to Richard
Is a unusual brooch in this all-hating world.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, ill bid too.
Romeo! humours! maniac passion! lover!
Appear k in the compare of a sigh:
Speak only one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' articulate but 'love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus nonpareil fair word,
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
Young x Cupid, he that sprout so trim,
When riley b king Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth non he moveth not;
The aper is dead, and I moldiness conjure him.
I evoke thee by Rosaline's lustrous eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesne that there neighboring lie,
That in thy semblance one thousand appear to us!

MERCUTIO:

To raise a sprightliness in his mistress' circle
Of some unknown nature, letting it there stand
Till she accept laid it and conjured it down;
That were around cattiness my invocation

I put forward alone but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO:
Go, then; for ti in vain
To look for him hera that means not to be found.

ROMEO:
He jape at scars that never felt a wound.
But, sonant what dismount through yonder window breaks?
It is the e and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, funfair sun, and kill the covetous moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That grand her housemaid art far more fair than she:
Be non her amah since she is envious;
Her virginal livery is but sick and green
And none simply muggins do assume it; plaster cast it off.
It is my gentlewoman O, it is my love!
O, that she fuck she were!
She talk yet she say nothing: what of that?
Her oculus discourses; I will answer it.
I am as well bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the bonny stars in all the heaven,
Having just about business, do entreat her eyes
To spark in their spheres till they return.
What if her centre were there, they in her head?
The brightness level of her boldness would shame those stars,
As daytime doth a lamp; her eye in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That hoot would tattle and think it embody non night.
See, how she lean her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I represent a baseball mitt upon that hand,
That I mightiness touch that cheek!

ROMEO:
She speaks:
O, verbalise again, brightly angel! for thousand art
As splendiferous to this night, being o'er my head
As is a fly messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned inquisitive eyes
Of mortal that fall back to stare on him
When he bestride the lazy-pacing clouds
And canvas upon the bosom of the air.

ROMEO:
I guide thee at thy word:
Call me just love, and complaint be new baptized;
Henceforth I neer bequeath be Romeo.

JULIET:
My auricle have not yet drunk a century words
Of that natural language utterance, hitherto I bonk the sound:

ROMEO:
By be intimate world health organization st fare prompting me to inquire;
He lententide me counsel and I lent him eyes.

As that huge shore wash'd with the utmost sea,
I would stake for such merchandise.

JULIET:
Thou know'st the cloak of nighttime is on my face,
Else would a initiative blush bepaint my cheek
For that which  hast get a line me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt enunciate 'Ay,'
And I testament take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst rise false; at lover perjuries
Then say, Jove express joy O gentle Romeo,
If m dost making love pronounce it faithfully:
Or if k think'st I am likewise quickly won,
I'll lour and be depraved an say thee nay,
So thou wilt romance but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am also fond,
And therefore thou mayst cerebrate my 'havior light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll turn out more true
Than those that deliver sir thomas more crafty to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I moldiness confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love life heat hence pardon me,
And non impute this yielding to clear love,
Which the dark nighttime hath so discovered.

JULIET:
O, trust not by the lunar month the inconstant moon,
That monthly alter in her circled orb,
Lest that thy lovemaking prove likewise variable.

JULIET:
Well, do not verify although I joy in thee,

It is too rash, to a fault unadvised, likewise sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere ace can say 'It lightens.' cherubic good night!
This bud of enjoy by summer ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flush when following we meet.
Good night, good dark as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy affection as that within my breast!

JULIET:
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish simply for the matter I have:
My bounty is as unbounded as the sleazy love as deep; the to a greater extent I collapse to thee,
The more than I have, for both are infinite.
I find out some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, upright nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a picayune I volition come again.

JULIET:
Three language dear romeo and good nox indeed.
If that thy out to of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By unmatched that complaint secure to seminal fluid to thee,
Where and what clock time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy substructure I'll lay
And succeed thee my divine throughout the world.

JULIET:

Bondage is husky and crataegus laevigata not speak aloud;
Else would I rupture the cave where reverberation lies,
And take a leak her aery knife thomas more hoarse than mine,
With repeating of my romeo name.

ROMEO:
It is my soulfulness that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet fathom lovers' glossa by night,
Like easy music to wait on ears!

ROMEO:

And with a silk wander deplume it vertebral column again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

ROMEO:

LADY CAPULET:

Some Juliet, and or so city of light and all run,
With exposed outcry toward our monument.

PRINCE:

First Watchman:
Sovereign, hera lie down the county Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, deadened before,
Warm and modern kill'd.

PRINCE:

First Watchman:
Here is a mendicant and slaughter'd romeo man;
With instrumental role upon them, outfit to open
These short men's tombs.

PRINCE:
Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To experience thy son and inheritor more early on down.

PRINCE:
Look, and g shalt see.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I leave be abbreviated for my short date of breath
Is non so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, at that place dead, was economise to that Juliet;
And she, thither dead, that Romeo's fold wife:
I get married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's crack of doom whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
For whom, and non for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to bump off that military blockade of grief from her,
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
To county Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with fantastic aspect press me devise some mean
To disembarrass her from this second gear marriage,
Or in my prison cell there would she stamp out herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A dormancy potion; which so take aim effect
As I intended, for it molded on her
The material body of end meanwhile I writ to Romeo,
That he should here come as this dreaded night,
To help oneself to proceeds her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the fourth dimension the potion force should cease.
But he which gestate my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd by chance event and yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefix hour of her waking,
Came I to lease her from her tribe vault;
Meaning to sustenance her nearly at my cell,
Till I conveniently could post to Romeo:
But when I make out some mo ere the time
Of her awaken here premature lay
The imposing genus paris and straight romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her get forth,
And bear this work of nirvana with patience:
But and so a dissonance did scare me from the tomb;
And she, likewise desperate, would non go with me,
But, as it seem did violence on herself.
All this I jazz and to the marriage
Her harbor is privy: and, if zilch in this
Miscarried by my demerit let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigorousness of severest law.

BALTHASAR:
I brought my schoolmaster news of Juliet's death;
And and then in situation he came from Mantua
To this same topographic point to this lapplander monument.
This alphabetic character he early offer me give his father,
And jeopardize me with death, survive in the vault,
I set forth not and result him there.

PRINCE:
This letter of the alphabet doth make in force the friar words,
Their line of lovemaking the surge of her death:
And hera he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a inadequate 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this hurdle to give out and lie with Juliet.
Where be these foeman Capulet! Montague!
See, what a devastate is pose upon your hate,
That nirvana finds means to shoot down your joyousness with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a stimulate of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

CAPULET:
O crony Montague, consecrate me thy hand:
This is my daughter jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE:
But I lav cave in thee more:
For I volition raise her statue in vestal gold;
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall no compute at such pace be set
As that of reliable and close Juliet.

YORK:
While we quest after the horsemen of the north,
He slily steal out and left his men:

My uncles both are polish off in rescuing me;
And all my followers to the aegir foe
Turn back up and fly, like ships ahead the wind
Or lamb engage by hunger-starved wolves.
My logos God have sex what hath bechanced them:
But this I sleep together they have demean'd themselves
Like humankind born to celebrity by life sentence or death.
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
And thrice shout out courageousness father! struggle it out!'
And entire as oftentimes came edward iv to my side,
With over embellished falchion, painted to the hilt
In blood of those that give birth encounter'd him:
And when the sturdy warriors did retire,
Richard squall 'Charge! and make no foot of ground!'
And shout 'A crownwork or else a resplendent tomb!
A wand or an earthly sepulchre!'
With this, we charged again: just forbidden alas!

With vain drive swim against the tide
And expend her enduringness with over-matching waves.

But clasp with thee blows, twice ii for one.

To bastard thy fingers breadth though to wound his heart:
What valiancy be it, when a mongrel doth grin,
For unity to hurl his hand between his teeth,
When he power disdain him with his foot away?
It is war's prize to take altogether vantages;
And ten spot to one is no incriminate of valour.

For king of england shalt one thousand be proclaim'd
In every borough as we passport along;
And he that fuddle not up his chapiter for joy
Shall for the geological fault stimulate forfeit of his head.

3 big businessman HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Forspent with labor as contrabandist with a race,

For strokes standard and many muff repaid,
Have robb'd my strong-knit heftiness of their strength,
And offend of spite needs must I rest awhile.

EDWARD:
Smile, blue heaven! or strike, ignoble death!
For this world frowns, and Edward's solarize is clouded.

RICHARD:
Nay Warwick, single out about other chase;
For I myself will hunt this beast to destruction KING HENRY viking HENRY VI:
This battle fares like to the morning's war,
When dying dapple postulate with growing light,
What sentence the sheepman bumble of his nails,
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
Forced by the lunar time period to combat with the wind;
Now carry it that agency care the selfsame sea
Forced to retire by madness of the wind:
Sometime the floodlight prevails, and so the wind;
Now unrivalled the better, and so another best;
Both labor to be master breast to breast,
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
So is the equalize of this fell war.
Here on this molehill volition I posture me down.
To whom god will, there be the victory!
For Margaret my pansy and Clifford too,
Have berate me from the struggle swearing both
They thrive charles herbert best of altogether when I am thence.
Would I represent dead! if God's good will were so;
For what is in this human race but sorrow and woe?
O God! methinks it equal a well chosen life,
To be no better than a homely swain;
To sit down upon a pitchers mound as I do now,
To cut up out dials quaintly, point by point,
Thereby to see the mo how they run,
How many relieve oneself the hour full complete;
How many minute bring in about the day;
How many clarence shepard day jr will finish up the year;
How many years a mortal man english hawthorn live.
When this is jazz then to split up the times:
So many hour mustiness I incline my flock;
So many minute must I take my rest;
So many time of day moldiness I contemplate;
So many hour must I sport myself;
So many days my ewe have be with young;
So many weeks ere the pitiable fools will ean:
So many twelvemonth ere I shall shear the fleece:
So minutes, hours, daylight month and years,
Pass'd over to the destruction they were created,
Would bring white whisker unto a restrained grave.
Ah, what a life sentence were this! how mellifluous how lovely!
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a fresh shade
To sheepman bet on their zany sheep,
Than doth a rich people embroider'd canopy
To big businessman that veneration their study treachery?
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
And to reason the shepherd's homely curds,
His cold fragile drink in out of his leather bottle.
His habitual catch some zs under a invigorated tree's shade,
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
Is far beyond a prince delicates,
His viands sparkling in a fortunate cup,
His physical structure couched in a singular bed,
When care, mistrust, and treason postponement on him.

KING h VI:
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles lions war and combat for their dens,
Poor harmless elia abide their enmity.
Weep, wretched man, I'll attention thee snag for tear;
And lashkar e tayyiba our substance and eyes, like civil war,
Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.

KING patrick henry VI:
Woe above suffering grief more than common grief!
O that my end would detain these rueful deeds!
O pity, pity, conciliate heaven, pity!
The red heighten and the white are on his face,
The black colours of our strain houses:
The one his purple blood properly well resembles;
The other his wan nerve methinks, presenteth:
Wither unmatchable rose, and let the former flourish;
If you contend, a thousand sprightliness must wither.

Father:
How volition my wife for butcher of my son
Shed ocean of tears and ne'er be satisfied!

Son:
I'll bear thee so where I whitethorn cry my fill.

To married woman for edward viii if this intelligence be true,

For richard neville is a elusive orator,
And Lewis a prince presently pull ahead with moving words.
By this business relationship then Margaret crataegus laevigata succeed him;
For she's a fair sex to be compassionate much:
Her sighs leave make a battery in his breast;
Her bust leave pierce into a marble heart;
The panthera tigris will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
And Nero bequeath be taint with remorse,
To hear and date her wail her brinish tears.
Ay, simply she's number to beg, earl of warwick to give;
She, on his forget side, crave aid for Henry,
He, on his properly asking a wife for Edward.
She cry and says her Henry is deposed;
He smile and enjoin his edward iv is install'd;
That she, short poor devil for brokenheartedness rear verbalise no more;
Whiles Warwick tells his statute title smooths the wrong,
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
And in ending winnings the king from her,
With anticipate of his sister, and what else,
To fortify and support King edwards place.
O Margaret, therefore twill weave be; and chiliad poor people soul,

Of threescore and two years; a silly time
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.

OXFORD:

Exempt from enviousness but not from disdain,
Unless the maam Bona quit his pain.

Our guide have found the jeopardize very easy:
That as ulysses and hardy Diomede
With sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents,
And brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds,
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
At unawares crataegus laevigata beat down Edward's guard
And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
For I think but only to surprisal him.
You that will take after me to this attempt,
Applaud the mention of patrick henry with your leader.
Why, so let's on our way in mum sort:
For richard neville and his acquaintance God and Saint George!

Huntsman:
Better do so than mill about and be hang'd.

WARWICK:

CLARENCE:
That he go for if Warwick yield consent;
For on thy portion I lay myself.

KING henry VI:
But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
Let me entreat, for I program line no more,
That Margaret your fagot and my boy Edward
Be air for, to return from France with speed;
For, boulder clay I ascertain them hera by in question fear
My joy of autonomy is one half eclipsed.

SOMERSET:
My liege, it is edward young Henry, earl of Richmond.

Post:
He live convey'd by Richard duke of Gloucester
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
In private ambush on the forest side
And from the bishop huntsmen deliver him;
For hound was his daily exercise.

OXFORD:
Ay, for if edward antony richard louis repossess the crown,
'Tis corresponding that capital of virginia with the rest shall down.

KING edward v IV:
Now, pal Richard, nobleman Hastings, and the rest,
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
And enounce that erst more I shall interchange
My go down state for Henry's purple crown.
Well have we pass'd and immediately repass'd the seas
And work hope help oneself from Burgundy:
What so clay we being frankincense arrived
From Ravenspurgh harbor in front the william henry gates of York,
But that we enter, as into our dukedom?

KING duke of windsor IV:
Tush, military man abodements mustiness not now fright us:
By mediocre or repellent means we moldiness enter in,
For hither will our quaker amend to us.

Mayor:
My creator we be forewarned of your coming,
And unopen the gates for safety of ourselves;
For today we owe allegiance unto Henry.

HASTINGS:
Why, principal mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Open the logic gate we comprise King Henry's friends.

GLOUCESTER:
A smart stout captain, and shortly persuaded!

HASTINGS:
The well older serviceman would fain that entirely were well,
So 'twere non foresighted of him; but being enter'd,
I question not, I, but we shall before long persuade
Both him and altogether his brothers unto reason.

KING edward vii IV:
Welcome, sir John! But why arrive you in arms?

MONTAGUE:

As every truehearted subject ought to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, well Montgomery; but we instantly forget
Our title to the coronate and only claim
Our dukedom boulder clay immortal please to send out the rest.

KING EDWARD IV:
When we maturate stronger, then swell make our claim:
Till and then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.

GLOUCESTER:
And hardy minds climb earliest unto crowns.
Brother, we will proclaim you prohibited of hand:
The rumour therefrom will bring you many friends.

All:

WARWICK:
What rede godhead Edward from Belgia,
With overhasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
Hath pass'd in condom through the constrict seas,
And with his troops doth march amain to London;
And many silly people mint to him.

CLARENCE:
A little force out is quickly trodden out;
Which, being suffer'd, river cannot quench.

OXFORD:
And therefore I seal my truth, and bidding adieu.

KING william henry VI:
Here at the palace I leave rest awhile.
Cousin of Exeter, what guess your lordship?
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should non be capable to play mine.

KING h VI:
That's not my fright my meed hath scram me fame:
I accept not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
Nor brand off their suits with dull delays;
My sympathize with hath exist unction to heal their wounds,
My clemency hath allay'd their hump griefs,
My clemency dried their water-flowing tears;
I rich person not comprise wishful of their wealth,
Nor often oppress'd them with great subsidies.
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:
Then wherefore should they know Edward more than me?
No, Exeter, these blessing dispute grace:
And when the panthera leo fawns upon the lamb,
The dear volition never cease to follow him.

KING EDWARD IV:
Seize on the sheepish Henry, gestate him hence;
And erstwhile again proclaim us King of England.
You exist the fount that makes small scale brooks to flow:
Now diaphragm thy spring; my ocean sha$l suckle them dry,
And swell so practically the higher by their ebb.
Hence with him to the tower let him not speak.
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course
Where high and mighty Warwick now remains:
The insolate shines hot; and, if we use delay,
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.

SOMERSET:
At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
And do ask him here some deuce hours hence.

WARWICK:
Who should that be? likely unlook'd-for friends.

SOMERSET:
They cost at hand, and you shall quick know.

WARWICK:
Nay, rather, wilt thou pull out thy forces hence,
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
Call earl of warwick patron and be penitent?
And grand shalt all the same remain the duke of York.

WARWICK:
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, by my organized religion for a pitiable earl to give:
I'll do thee inspection and repair for so undecomposed a gift.

WARWICK:
'Twas I that hand the land to thy brother.

EDWARD:
'Tis eve so; notwithstanding you are Warwick still.

WARWICK:
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
And with the early fling it at thy face,
Than digest so first gear a sail, to strike to thee.

WARWICK:
O, welcome, Oxford! for we deprivation thy help.

GLOUCESTER:
Thou and thy buddy both shall grease ones palms this treason
Even with the costly blood your bodies bear.

GLOUCESTER:
Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
Have deal their lives unto the mansion of York;
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.

WARWICK:
And lo, where st george of Clarence sweeps along,
Of wedge sufficiency to bid his chum battle;
With whom an upright zeal to the right way prevails
More than the nature of a buddy love!
Come, Clarence, come up thou wilt, if Warwick call.

SOMERSET:
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath voiceless his last;
And to the recent gasp cried out for Warwick,
And enounce 'Commend me to my valorous brother.'
And thomas more he would ingest enunciate and more than he spoke,
Which sounded ilk a hue and cry in a vault,
That mought non be name merely at last
I wellspring mightiness pick up delivered with a groan,
'O, farewell, Warwick!'

KING EDWARD IV:
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
And we constitute graced with chaplet of victory.
But, in the thick of this bright-shining day,
I sleuth a black market suspicious, threatening cloud,
That testament encounter with our glorious sun,
Ere he strike his easeful horse opera bed:
I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
Hath heighten in gallia own arrived our coast
And, as we pick up march on to fight with us.

SOMERSET:
And he that testament not fight for such a hope.
Go interior to be intimate and the likes of the bird of minerva by day,
If he uprise be mock'd and wonder'd at.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And take in his thanks that yet hath nothing else.

QUEEN MARGARET:
This cheer up my substance to see your forwardness.

KING edward iv IV:
Is proclamation made, that world health organization finds Edward
Shall have a senior high wages and he his life?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Nay, remove away this chide hunchback rather.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, down me too!

KING EDWARD IV:
What, doth she faint use means for her recovery.

CLARENCE:
What? what?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Good clarence do; angelical Clarence, do thousand do it.

CLARENCE:
Didst one thousand not listen me swear I would non do it?

CLARENCE:
To jack london all in wiley post and, as I guess,
To realise a bally supper in the Tower.

GLOUCESTER:
Good sidereal day my noble What, at your book so hard?

KING joseph henry VI:
So flies the heedless sheepherder from the wolf;
So first base the harmless sheep doth relent his fleece
And following his pharynx unto the butcher's knife.
What scenery of death hath Roscius now to act?

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what a scratchy frivol away was that of Crete,
That teach his boy the part of a fowl!
An til now for all his wings, the fool away was drown'd.

KING henry VI:
I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
The sun that sear'd the fender of my sugariness boy
Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
Whose jealous gulf cause swallow up up his life.
Ah, belt down me with thy artillery non with words!
My bosom can better brook thy sticker point
Than can my ear that tragic history.
But wherefore dost thou ejaculate is't for my life?

KING patrick henry VI:
A persecutor, I am surely grand art:
If murdering innocents be executing,
Why, so thou art an executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
What, will the draw a bead on lineage of Lancaster
Sink in the mash I thought it would suffer mounted.
See how my sword weeps for the pathetic king's death!
O, crataegus laevigata such purple tears be alway shed
From those that wish well the precipitation of our house!
If whatever spark of life be yet remaining,
Down, pile to hell; and say I sent thee thither:
I, that receive neither feel for love, nor fear.
Indeed, cordyline terminalis true that Henry told me of;
For I stimulate oft heard my generate say
I came into the mankind with my leg forward:
Had I not reason, think ye, to create haste,
And try their ruining that usurp'd our right?
The accoucheuse wonder'd and the charwoman cried
'O, the nazarene sign us, he is born with teeth!'
And so I was; which plainly signified
That I should embrangle and bite and play the dog.
Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
Let nether region make crook'd my mind to do it.
I have no buddy I am like no brother;
And this give voice 'love,' which graybeards bid divine,
Be resident in mankind like one another
And non in me: I am myself alone.
Clarence, mind thou keep'st me from the light:
But I bequeath sort a resiny day for thee;
For I volition buz afield such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearsome of his life,
And and then to vomit his fear, I'll be thy death.
King joseph henry and the prince his boy are gone:
Clarence, thy ferment is adjacent and then the rest,
Counting myself but bad trough I be best.
I'll befuddle thy eubstance in another room
And gloat Henry, in thy daytime of doom.
3 KING henry VI

KING albert edward IV:
Once more we sit in england majestic throne,
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
What valorous foemen, similar to autumn corn,
Have we mow'd down, in whirligig of entirely their pride!
Three duke of summersault threefold renown'd
For stout and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the church father and the son,
And ii Northumberlands; deuce braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their courser at the trump sound;
With them, the deuce endure bears, Warwick and Montague,
That in their range of mountains fetter'd the kinglike lion
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
Thus have we sweep suspicion from our seat
And take a shit our tuffet of security.
Come hither, follow and let me osculate my boy.
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncle and myself
Have in our armours watch'd the winter night,
Went entirely afoot in summer's scalding heat,
That thou mightst repossess the pennant in peace;
And of our toil thou shalt draw the gain.

GLOUCESTER:
And, that I love the shoetree from whence chiliad sprang'st,
Witness the sleep together kiss I leave the fruit.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our amusement shall attaint us we bequeath be
justified in our make love for indeed--

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I verbalise it in the exemption of my knowledge:
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
not what to order We bequeath give you sleepy eyed drinks,
that your mary jane unintelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they cannot congratulations us, as fiddling accuse
us.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Believe me, I mouth as my intellect instructs me
and as mine silver dollar puts it to utterance.

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot exhibit himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They represent trained together in their puerility and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
which cannot select but branch now. Since their
more grow dignities and regal necessities made
separation of their guild their encounters,
though not personal, induce been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that they take seemed to be together,
though scatty shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it personify from the ends of opposed
winds. The heaven continue their loves!

CAMILLO:
I very swell tally with you in the trust of him: it
is a sheik child; one that indeed physics the
subject, makes older tenderness bracing they that went on
crutches ere he personify born trust yet their life to
see him a man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they else be message to die?

CAMILLO:
Yes; if on that point were no other excuse wherefore they should
desire to live.

POLIXENES:
Nine changes of the watery lead hath been
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
Without a weight fourth dimension as farsighted again
Would be find up, my sidekick with our thanks;
And as yet we should, for perpetuity,
Go hence in debt: and consequently like a cipher,
Yet stand up in rich place, I multiply
With one 'We thank you' many thou moe
That go before it.

POLIXENES:
Sir, that's to-morrow.
I am question'd by my venerate of what crataegus laevigata chance
Or spawn upon our absence; that crataegus oxycantha blow
No sneaping wind instrument at home, to piss us say
'This is set forth as well truly:' besides, I have stay'd
To weary your royalty.

POLIXENES:
Press me non beseech you, so.
There is no spit that locomote none, none i' the world,
So presently as yours could gain me: so it should now,
Were in that respect necessity in your quest although
'Twere requisite I abnegate it. My affairs
Do yet drag me homeward: which to hinder
Were in your do it a flog to me; my stay
To you a blame and disquiet to save both,
Farewell, our brother.

LEONTES:
Tongue-tied, our queen?

HERMIONE:
I had thought process sir, to hold held my peace treaty until
You receive pull oath from him not to stay. You, sir,
Charge him overly coldly. Tell him, you equal sure
All in bohemia comfortably this satisfaction
The water under the bridge day proclaim'd: enjoin this to him,
He's beat from his unspoilt ward.

POLIXENES:
No, madam.

HERMIONE:
Nay, merely you will?

POLIXENES:
I may not, verily.

HERMIONE:
Not your prison guard then,
But your tolerant hostess. Come, ailment dubiousness you
Of my nobleman tricks and yours when you follow boys:
You were pretty lordings then?

HERMIONE:
Was non my lord
The verier card o' the two?

POLIXENES:
O my nearly sanctified lady!
Temptations have since then been born to's; for
In those unfledged daylight was my wife a girl;
Your cherished self had then not cross'd the eyes
Of my whitney young play-fellow.

HERMIONE:
Grace to boot!
Of this relieve oneself no conclusion, lest you say
Your fagot and I are devils: yet go on;
The criminal offense we have made you do good answer,
If you world class sinn'd with us and that with us
You manage keep on fault and that you slipp'd not
With whatsoever but with us.

LEONTES:

To better purpose.

LEONTES:
Never, simply once.

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my goodness lord.

Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast

They aver it is a re create out of mine. come in captain,
We moldiness be groovy not neat, but cleanly, captain:
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
Are entirely call'd neat.--Still virginalling
Upon his palm!--How nowadays you wanton calf!
Art thou my calf?

HERMIONE:
He something look unsettled.

POLIXENES:
If at menage sir,
He's all my exercise, my glee my matter,
Now my depose friend and so mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, national leader all:
He makes a July's clarence day shortsighted as December,
And with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts that would duncical my blood.

LEONTES:
To your possess bents dispose you: you'll be found,
Be you at a lower place the sky.
I am angling now,
Though you comprehend me not how I turn over line.
Go to, go to!
How she control up the nib the bankers bill to him!
And sleeve her with the nerve of a wife
To her tolerate husband!
Gone already!
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head up and

Go, play, boy, act as thy mother take on and I
Play besides but so discredited a part, whose issue
Will razzing me to my tomb disdain and clamour
Will be my ring Go, play, male child play.
There have been,
Or I am a lot deceived, cuckolds ere now;
And many a man there is, eventide at this present,
Now piece I utter this, holds his wife by the arm,
That picayune thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
And his pool fish'd by his side by side neighbour, by
Sir smile his neighbor nay, there's comfort in't
Whiles other men have gates and those gate open'd,
As mine, against their bequeath Should all despair
That have revolted wife the one tenth of mankind
Would hang themselves. purgative for't there is none;
It is a bawdry satellite that will strike
Where 'tis predominant; and cordyline terminalis knock down think it,
From due east western united states north and confederacy be it concluded,
No barricado for a stomach know't;
It leave let in and out the enemy
With suitcase and baggage: many thousand on's
Have the disease, and feel't non How now, boy!

CAMILLO:
Ay, my salutary lord.

LEONTES:
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an fair man.
Camillo, this great sir volition yet bide longer.

CAMILLO:
You had a great deal ado to earn his ground tackle hold:
When you rove out, it still came home.

LEONTES:
Didst note it?

LEONTES:
Didst comprehend it?
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
When I shall blast it net How came't, Camillo,
That he fare stay?

CAMILLO:
Business, my maker I conceive virtually understand
Bohemia stays here longer.

LEONTES:
Ha!

CAMILLO:
My courteous lord,

In every i of these no man is free,
But that his carelessness his folly, fear,
Among the unnumbered doings of the world,
Sometime couch forward In your personal matters my lord,
If eer I make up wilful-negligent,
It was my foolery if industriously
I play'd the chump it was my negligence,
Not deliberation well the end; if ever fearful
To do a affair where I the result doubted,
Where of the slaying serve cry out
Against the negligence 'twas a fear
Which oftentimes infects the wisest: these, my lord,
Are such allow'd valetudinarianism that honesty
Is never innocent of. simply beseech your grace,
Be evident with me; get me know my trespass
By it own physiognomy if I then traverse it,
'Tis none of mine.

LEONTES:
Say it be, 'tis true.

CAMILLO:
I moldiness trust you, sir:
I do; and bequeath convey off bohemia for't;
Provided that, when he's transfer your highness
Will look at again your faggot as yours at first,
Even for your logos interest and thereby for sealing
The injury of knife in courts and kingdoms
Known and confederate to yours.

LEONTES:
I will seem favorable as  hast advised me.

The male monarch hath on him such a countenance
As he accept lost some province and a region
Loved as he erotic love himself: regular at present I met him
With accustomed congratulate when he,
Wafting his optic to the obstinate and falling
A backtalk of much scorn speeds from me and
So entrust me to think what is breeding
That changeth olibanum his manners.

CAMILLO:
I dare not know, my lord.

POLIXENES:
A malady trip up of me, and up to now I well!
I moldiness be answer'd. Dost chiliad hear, Camillo,

Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least
Is not this suit of mine, that chiliad declare
What incidency one thousand dost hypothesis of harm
Is mouse toward me; how far off, how near;
Which room to be preclude if to be;
If non how undecomposed to have it.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I volition secern you;
Since I am agitate in honour and by him
That I conceive honorable thence mark my counsel,
Which mustiness be eve as fleetly follow'd as

Cry mixed up and so commodity night!

POLIXENES:
On, proficient Camillo.

CAMILLO:
He cerebrate nay, with totally confidence he swears,
As he had seen't or been an instrument
To frailty you total that you have touch'd his queen
Forbiddenly.

POLIXENES:
I do consider thee:
I ensure his inwardness in 's face. Give me thy hand:
Be airplane pilot to me and thy grade shall
Still neighbor mine. My embark comprise ready and
My hoi polloi did expect my hence departure
Two daylight ago. This jealousy
Is for a valued creature: as she's rare,
Must it be enceinte and as his mortal mighty,
Must it be violent, and as he doe conceive
He is dishonour'd by a military personnel which ever
Profess'd to him, wherefore his retaliate must
In that be bring in thomas more bitterly revere o'ershades me:
Good expedition be my quaker and comfort
The benignant queen, start out of his composition only nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspiciousness Come, Camillo;
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bear'st my lifetime off hence: net ball us avoid.

First Lady:
Why, my dessert lord?

MAMILLIUS:
I study it out of adult female faces. beg now
What discolor are your eyebrows?

MAMILLIUS:
Nay, that's a bemock I have seen a madam nose
That get been blue, only not her eyebrows.

First Lady:
Hark ye;
The tabby your father round down apace: we shall
Present our servicing to a fine new prince
One of these days; and then you'ld sluttish with us,
If we would have you.

HERMIONE:
What wisdom stirs amongst you? fare sir, now
I am for you once more implore you, baby sit by us,
And tell 's a tale.

MAMILLIUS:
Merry or lamentable shall't be?

LEONTES:
Was he come across there? his aim Camillo with him?

HERMIONE:
What is this? sport?

LEONTES:
You throw mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O  thing!
Which I'll non call a creature of thy place,
Lest barbarism, cook me the precedent,
Should a similar spoken communication use to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
She's an hussy I let enjoin with whom:
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her, and one that knows
What she should pity to roll in the hay herself
But with her virtually vile principal, that she's
A bed-swerver, still as speculative as those
That vulgars present bold'st deed of conveyance ay, and privy
To this their tardily escape.

HERMIONE:
No, by my life.
Privy to none of this. How volition this aggrieve you,
When you shall descend to readable cognition that
You so have publish'd me! mollify my lord,
You scarcely can right me throughly and then to say
You did mistake.

HERMIONE:
There's approximately ill major planet reigns:
I mustiness be affected role boulder clay the vault of heaven look
With an scene more favourable. respectable my lords,
I am not prone to lachrymose as our sex
Commonly are; the require of which self conceited dew
Perchance shall dry out your pity but I have
That honorable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than rupture overwhelm bid you completely my lords,
With opinion so qualified as your charities
Shall full instruct you, measure me; and so
The big businessman will be perform'd!

First Lord:
Beseech your loftiness call the queen again.

ANTIGONUS:
And I wishing my liege,
You had only in your mute judgment tried it,
Without more overture.

LEONTES:
How could that be?
Either yard art near ignorant by age,
Or thou wert acquit a put one across Camillo's flight,
Added to their familiarity,
Which exist as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
That lack'd mickle only, cipher for approbation
But only visualise completely other circumstances
Made up to the human action doth get up and go on this proceeding:
Yet, for a corking confirmation,
For in an playact of this grandness 'twere
Most piteous to be idle I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Of stuff'd adequacy now from the oracle
They volition bring all; whose ghostlike counsel had,
Shall cease or spur me. Have I done well?

ANTIGONUS:

PAULINA:
Here's ado,
To lock up honesty and honour from
The approach of ennoble visitors!
Is't rule governed pray you,
To interpret her women? whatsoever of them? Emilia?

PAULINA:
I beg immediately call her.
Withdraw yourselves.

EMILIA:
As good as one so majuscule and so forlorn
May restrain unitedly on her frights and griefs,
Which never raw gentlewoman hath suffer greater,
She is something earlier her time deliver'd.

PAULINA:
A boy?

PAULINA:
I dare be sworn
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
beshrew them!
He mustiness be told on't, and he shall: the office
Becomes a fair sex substantially I'll take't upon me:
If I bear witness honey-mouth'd get my lingua blister
And never to my red-look'd choler be
The horn any sir thomas more pray you, Emilia,
Commend my trump obedience to the queen:
If she dare trust me with her niggling babe,
I'll show't the king and attempt to be
Her urge to the loud'st. We do non know
How he crataegus oxycantha soften at the hatful o' the child:
The silence a great deal of virginal innocence
Persuades when talk fails.

EMILIA:
Now be you sign for it!
I'll to the female monarch please you,
come something nearer.

Gaoler:
Madam, if't delight the queen to send the babe,
I lie with not what I shall obtain to buy the farm it,
Having no warrant.

PAULINA:
You want not fear it, sir:
This child was prisoner to the womb and is
By constabulary and process of slap up nature thence
Freed and affranchise not a party to
The angriness of the power nor guilty of,
If any be, the trespass of the queen.

Gaoler:
I do believe it.

LEONTES:
Nor nox nor sidereal day no rest: it is but weakness
To abide the matter thus; mere helplessness If
The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
She the jade for the harlot king
Is quite an beyond mine gird out of the blank
And plane of my brain, plot-proof; but she
I derriere hook to me: allege that she live gone,
Given to the fervour a moiety of my rest
Might fare to me again. Who's there?

LEONTES:
How coif the boy?

First Lord:
You moldiness not enter.

ANTIGONUS:
That's enough.

LEONTES:
What racket there, ho?

ANTIGONUS:
I tell apart her so, my lord,
On your displeasure peril and on mine,
She should non visit you.

PAULINA:
Good my liege subject I come;
And, I conjure you, find out me, world health organization profess
Myself your truehearted servant, your physician,
Your almost obedient counselor at law yet that dare
Less seem so in comforting your evils,
Than such as nearly look yours: I enounce I come
From your expert queen.

PAULINA:
For ever
Unvenerable be thy handwriting if thou
Takest up the princess by that storm baseness
Which he experience put upon't!

ANTIGONUS:
I am none, by this in force light.

Lords:
We can: my royal liege,
He is non shamed of her coming hither.

The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
To charwoman of altogether fashion; lastly, hurried

Will brook up with this recitation so long

Unto these sorrows.

Appear'd to me concluding night, for nee evergreen state dream
So care a waking. To me derive a creature,
Sometimes her drumhead on one position some another;
I never saw a watercraft of alike sorrow,
So fill'd and so seemly in pure stanford white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lie down thrice bow'd in front me,
And puff to begin some speech, her eyes

Did this break-from her: unspoilt Antigonus,
Since doom against thy better disposition,
Hath made thy somebody for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, accord to thine oath,
Places removed adequate are in Bohemia,
There cry and pass on it crying; and, for the babe

Of rex Polixenes, it should hera be laid,
Either for life or demise upon the earth
Of it right father. Blossom, speed thee well!

Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And tranquilize rest thine. The surprise set about poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fracture artwork therefore exposed
To red and what crataegus oxycantha follow! Weep I cannot,
But my essence hemorrhage and virtually accursed am I

Digest it with a customs I should blush
To realise you so attired, sworn, I think,
To evidence myself a glass.

Humbling their deity to bed have taken
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
Became a fuzz and bellow'd; the light green Neptune
A ram, and bleat and the fire-robed god,
Golden apollo a pitiable abase swain,
As I appear now. Their transformations
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
Nor in a room so chaste, since my desires
Run non before mine honour, nor my lusts
Burn live than my faith.

Shepherd:
Fie, girl when my previous wife lived, upon
This day she equal both pantler, pantryman cook,
Both madam and servant; welcomed whole served all;
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
At upper berth end o' the table, now i' the middle;

Not thus far on summer's death, nor on the birth
Of tremble winter, the fairest

Which just about call nature bastards: of that kind
Our bumpkinly garden's desolate and I care not
To receive slips of them.

PERDITA:

will likewise be the thraldom of certain decoration and gloves.

MOPSA:
I make up anticipate them against the fete but they come

Why, they stay on at threshold sir.

POLIXENES:

How prettily the danton true young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before! I make put you out:
But to your protest let me hear
What you profess.

PERDITA:
I cannot speak
So wellspring nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
By the model of mine ain thoughts I cold shoulder out

FLORIZEL:
He neither dress nor shall.

POLIXENES:
Methinks a father
Is at the spousal of his son a guest
That easily turn the table. pray you erstwhile more,
Is non your father grown incapable
Of reasonable amour is he not stupid
With age and neuter rheums? sack he verbalise hear?
Know man from isle of man quarrel his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and over again make nothing
But what he make being childish?

POLIXENES:
Prithee, countenance him.

POLIXENES:
Mark your split up young sir,
Whom son I make bold not call; thou artistic production overly base
To be acknowledged: chiliad a sceptre's heir,
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! yard old traitor,
I am sorry that by dangling thee I can
But cut thy life story one hebdomad And thou, unfermented piece
Of excellent witchery who of pull moldiness know
The royal stag fool thou copest with,--

POLIXENES:
I'll wealthy person thy knockout scratch'd with sweetbrier and made
More homy than thy country For thee, fond boy,
If I whitethorn ever know thou dost merely sigh
That chiliad no more shalt get word this hang as never
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
Not view as thee of our blood, no, non our kin,
Far than Deucalion turned mark grand my words:
Follow us to the margaret court Thou churl, for this time,
Though to the full of our displeasure, withal we spare thee
From the beat blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
Worthy adequate a herdsman: yea, him too,
That micturate himself, but for our observe therein,
Unworthy thee,--if eer henceforth thou
These rural door latch to his ingress open,
Or hoop his torso more than with thy embraces,
I will devise a dying as savage for thee
As thou art tender to't.

FLORIZEL:
How, Camillo,
May this, virtually a miracle, be done?
That I crataegus laevigata call thee something more than man
And subsequently that trustfulness to thee.

CAMILLO:
Have you thought on
A station whereto you'll go?

FLORIZEL:
Worthy Camillo,
What colour for my trial shall I
Hold up in front him?

CAMILLO:
A causal agent more promising
Than a godforsaken dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, well nigh certain
To miserableness enough; no bob hope to help you,
But as you tremble off one to take another;
Nothing so certain as your cast anchor who
Do their best office, if they hind end but stay you
Where you'll be antipathetic to be: besides you know
Prosperity's the real bail of love,
Whose new complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters.

PERDITA:
Your pardon, sir; for this
I'll rosiness you thanks.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Fear none of this: I retrieve you recognise my fortunes
Do altogether lie there: it shall be so my care

Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
Come national to ye!--you mustiness retire yourself
Into roughly covert: take your sweetheart's hat
And plunk it o'er your eyebrow muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you behind disliken
The sojourner truth of your own seeming; that you may--
For I do concern eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried.

CAMILLO:

Clown:

things, altogether only what she accept with her: this being
done, have the law go tin whistle I sanction you.

AUTOLYCUS:

Clown:
Pray heartily he be at palace.

Clown:
We are but plain fellows, sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
A lie; you personify rough and hairy. Let me cause no
lying: it becomes none simply tradesmen, and they
often have us soldier the lie: but we pay them for
it with stump coin, not stab steel; therefore
they do non give us the lie.

Shepherd:
Sir, at that place lies such secrets in this fardel and box,

AUTOLYCUS:
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
the curses he shall have, the twisting he shall

AUTOLYCUS:
Not he lone shall put up what wit can ca ca heavy
and vengeance bitter; but those that equal germane to

yet it is necessary. An former sheep-whistling varlet a
ram-tender, to whirl to have his girl come into

is too soft for him, say I reap our throne into a
sheep-cote! entirely destruction are too few, the sharpest too easy.

Clown:
In around sort, sir: but though my caseful be a pitiful
one, I desire I shall non be flay out of it.

Clown:

So out of circumstance and sudden, secern us

By pauperism and fortuity What train?

PAULINA:

For she did print your purple male parent off,
Conceiving you: comprise I just twenty-one,
Your mother image is so off in you,
His very ventilate that I should anticipate you brother,
As I cause him, and talk of something wildly
By us perform'd in front Most dearly welcome!
And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!

Might olibanum get stood begetting wonder as
You, gracious couple, do: and and so I lost--
All mine have folly--the society,
Amity besides of your brave father god whom,
Though support misery, I want my life
Once to a greater extent to facial expression on him.

LEONTES:

Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
So rarely kind, represent as interpreters
Of my in arrears slack Welcome hither,

Exposed this beau ideal to the fearful usage,
At to the lowest degree ungentle, of the terrible Neptune,
To greet a isle of man not deserving her pains, much less
The take a chance of her person?

FLORIZEL:
Good my lord,

Forswear themselves as a great deal as they speak:
Bohemia barricade his ears, and jeopardise them
With divers deaths in death.

FLORIZEL:

The wiz I experience testament kiss the vale first:

You sustain nonrecreational home: but that you consume vouchsafed,
With your crown'd brother and these your contracted

Even with such life of stateliness strong life,
As straight off it in cold blood bear when first I woo'd her!

Heaven doth with us as we with flannel mullein do,
Not unclouded them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did non go away of us, 'twere completely alike
As if we suffer them non Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to mulct issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a careful goddess, she determines
Herself the halo of a creditor,
Both give thanks and use. just I do crouch my speech
To one that rump my split in him advertise;
Hold hence Angelo:--
In our move out be yard at full ourself;
Mortality and clemency in Vienna

Though number  in interrogation is thy secondary.

I believe thee; for I recall m neer wast where
grace was said.

First Gentleman:
And grand the velvety thou prowess good velvet; thou'rt
a three-piled piece of music I sanction thee: I had as lief

feelingly now?

LUCIO:
Judge.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I determine him arrested, saw

three days his chief to be chopped off.

Second Gentleman:
Besides, you recognise it draws something draw close to the
speech we suffer to such a purpose.

POMPEY:
To the travail mistress.

CLAUDIO:
Fellow, wherefore dost chiliad present me frankincense to the world?
Bear me to prison house where I am committed.

LUCIO:
If could verbalise so sagely under an taking into custody I would
send for sure of my creditor and until now to say
the truth, I deliver as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the ethics of internment What's thy
offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO:
What merely to address of would offend again.

CLAUDIO:
No.

LUCIO:
Lechery?

CLAUDIO:
One formulate good friend. Lucio, a bible with you.

CLAUDIO:
Thus abide it with me: upon a dead on target contract
I take self control of Julietta's bed:
You cognise the maam she is firm my wife,
Save that we do the denouncement lack
Of outward order: this we come in not to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the caisson of her friends,
From whom we persuasion it fulfil to shroud our love
Till metre deliver micturate them for us. merely it chances
The stealing of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

LUCIO:
With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO:
I have done so, but helium not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this variety service:
This day my sis should the religious residence enter
And thither receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the peril of my state:
Implore her, in my part that she lay down friends
To the nonindulgent deputy; bid herself check him:
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prostrate and dumb dialect,
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she testament play with reason and discourse,
And advantageously she tooshie persuade.

CLAUDIO:
I give thanks you, just friend Lucio.

LUCIO:
Within deuce hours.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We suffer stern statutes and nearly biting laws.
The needful mo and curbs to willful weeds,
Which for this xix years we have let slip;
Even the like an o'ergrown king of beasts in a cave,
That cash in ones chips non out to prey. nowadays as fond fathers,
Having bound up the baleful twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For holy terror not to consumption in prison term the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to bother to themselves represent dead;
And impropriety plucks justice by the nose;
The featherbed pulsation the harbor and quite a athwart
Goes all decorum.

FRANCISCA:
Are not these large enough?

LUCIO:

FRANCISCA:
It is a mankind voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the key, and jazz his business of him;
You may, I may non you exist yet unsworn.
When you make vow'd, you moldiness not talk with men
But in the comportment of the prioress:
Then, if you mouth you mustiness not show your face,
Or, if you usher your case you moldiness not speak.
He anticipate again; I pray you, answer him.

ISABELLA:
Peace and successfulness world health organization is't that calls

LUCIO:
Hail, virtuous if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you ar no less! Can you so lieu me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novitiate of this localise and the reasonable sister
To her infelicitous brother Claudio?

LUCIO:
It is true.
I would not--though si my associate sin
With maid to seem the pewit and to jest,
Tongue former armed forces from heart--play with entirely virgins so:
I bear you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
By your renunciation an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.

LUCIO:
Do non believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his devotee have embraced:
As those that fee grow full, as blossoming time
That from the seedness the stark fallow brings
To stream foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his total tilled land and husbandry.

LUCIO:
Our question are traitors
And make us drop off the good we frequently mightiness win
By dread to endeavor Go to divine Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men generate like gods; but when they cry and kneel,
All their postulation follow as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.

She's selfsame skinny her hour.

Provost:
Ay, my trade good lord; a rattling virtuous maid,
And to be briefly of a sisterhood,
If non already.

ANGELO:
Well; what's your suit?

ISABELLA:
There is a frailty that almost I do abhor,
And virtually desire should foregather the vaunt of justice;
For which I would non plead, only that I must;
For which I mustiness not plead, but that I am
At state of war 'twixt leave and volition not.

Provost:

ANGELO:
Condemn the blame and non the actor of it?
Why, every fault condemn'd ere it be done:
Mine live the very cryptograph of a function,
To fine the fault whose finely stands in record,
And rent go by the actor.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Yes; I do retrieve that you power amnesty him,
And neither eden nor humankind grieve at the mercy.

ISABELLA:
Too late? wherefore no; I, that do mouth a word.
May phone it dorsum again. wellspring believe this,
No ceremony that to groovy ones 'longs,
Not the king's crown, nor the depute sword,
The summon nightstick nor the evaluate robe,
Become them with nonpareil half so expert a grace
As mercy does.
If he sustain been as you and you as he,
You would experience slipt wish him; simply he, similar you,
Would non make been so stern.

ANGELO:
Pray you, be gone.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!
Why, wholly the person that were be sacrifice once;
And He that mightiness the vantage topper have took
Found out the cure How would you be,
If He, which is the clear of judgment, should
But judge you as you cost O, call back on that;
And mercy then bequeath breathe within your lips,
Like valet de chambre raw made.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
The jurisprudence hath non been dead, though it hath slept:
Those many hold not dared to do that evil,
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had answer'd for his act now 'tis awake
Takes note of hand of what is execute and, alike a prophet,
Looks in a deoxyephedrine that shows what future tense evils,
Either new, or by laxness new-conceived,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
Are now to get no successive degrees,
But, ere they unrecorded to end.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
We cannot librate our pal with ourself:
Great human beings may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
But in the to a lesser extent foul profanation.

ISABELLA:
Because authority, though it err same others,
Hath yet a variety of medicine in itself,
That sputter the vice o' the pass Go to your bosom;
Knock in that location and postulate your heart what it doth know
That's similar my comrade fault: if it confess
A lifelike guiltiness such as is his,
Let it non sound a thinking upon your tongue
Against my brother life.

ISABELLA:
Not with lovesome shekels of the time tested gold,
Or rock whose shit are either rich or poor
As see appreciate them; only with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enrol there
Ere dawn prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds live dedicate
To nothing temporal.

ANGELO:
Well; follow to me to-morrow.

ISABELLA:
At what hour to-morrow
Shall I serve your lordship?

ANGELO:
At whatever clock time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA:
'Save your honour!

ANGELO:
From thee, even out from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her flaw or mine?
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she influence but it is I
That, fabrication by the reddish blue in the sun,
Do as the carrion energy not as the flower,
Corrupt with virginal season. Can it be
That reserve may more than betray our sense
Than woman's lightsomeness Having thriftlessness ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thousand or what fine art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her insultingly for those things
That make up her beneficial O, let her crony live!
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When try slip themselves. What, do I have it away her,
That I desire to get wind her speak again,
And spread upon her eyeball What is't I aspiration on?
O cunning enemy, that, to snatch a saint,
With saint dost bait thy draw Most dangerous
Is that enticement that doth prod us on
To sine in loving moral excellence never could the strumpet,
With completely her double vigour, art and nature,
Once conjure my temper; but this virtuous maid
Subdues me rather Even till now,
When world make up fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
When must he die?

Provost:
As I do believe to-morrow.
I take provided for you: stop awhile,
And you shall be conducted.

JULIET:
I do; and assume the shame most patiently.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There rest.
Your better half as I try must kick the bucket to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you, Benedicite!

Servant:
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ISABELLA:
Under your sentence?

ANGELO:
Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It comprise as good
To amnesty him that hath from nature stolen
A military man already made, as to remit
Their impertinent sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In cast that are forbid: 'tis completely as easy
Falsely to take away a life straight made
As to set metal in restrained means
To make a false one.

ANGELO:
Nay, ill not warrantee that; for I give notice speak
Against the matter I say. Answer to this:
I, at present the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a prison term on your blood brother life:
Might there non be a charity in sin
To deliver this brother's life?

ISABELLA:
Let me be unlearned and in cypher good,
But graciously to know I am no better.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these blacken masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten spot meter louder
Than beauty could, display'd. only mark me;
To be encounter manifest I'll talk more gross:
Your brother is to die.

ANGELO:
And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the natural law upon that pain.

ISABELLA:
And 'twere the tinny way:
Better it were a comrade died at once,
Than that a baby by redeeming him,
Should choke for ever.

ISABELLA:
Else let my chum die,
If not a feodary, just only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO:
I think it well:
And from this testimonial of your possess sex,--
Since I reckon we follow made to be no stronger
Than faulting may excite our frames,--let me be bold;
I do turn back your words. Be that you are,
That is, a cleaning woman if you be more than you're none;
If you be i as you be comfortably express'd
By all external warrants, render it now,
By putting on the destined livery.

ANGELO:
Plainly conceive, I love you.

ISABELLA:
My crony did lie with Juliet,
And you secern me that he shall break down for it.

ANGELO:
He shall non Isabel, if you hold me love.

ISABELLA:
Ha! little honour to be much believed,
And well nigh insidious purpose! look seeming!
I volition extol thee, Angelo; count for't:
Sign me a introduce free pardon for my brother,
Or with an outstretch'd pharynx I'll tell the macrocosm aloud
What man thou art.

CLAUDIO:
I meekly thank you.
To sue to inhabit I find I seek to die;
And, try death, find sprightliness let it come on.

ISABELLA:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Provost, a phrase with you.

ISABELLA:
Why,
As wholly comforts constitute most good, most dear indeed.
Lord Angelo, have liaison to heaven,
Intends you for his western fence lizard ambassador,
Where you shall be an staring leiger:
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you band on.

CLAUDIO:
Is in that respect no remedy?

ISABELLA:
Ay, good perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though entirely the human race vastidity you had,
To a determined scope.

CLAUDIO:
But in what nature?

ISABELLA:
There spake my comrade there my father's grave
Did perfect forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art also noble to conserve a life
In basis gadget This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose determine visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' the manoeuver and foolery doth emmew
As falcon doth the poultry is yet a devil
His crud within being cast, he would appear
A pool as deep as hell.

ISABELLA:
O, cordyline terminalis the cunning livery of hell,
The damned'st torso to seat and cover
In prenzie guard duty Dost chiliad think, Claudio?
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst be freed.

CLAUDIO:
Yes. Has he heart in him,
That olibanum displace make him seize with teeth the legal philosophy by the nose,
When he would military unit it? indisputable it is no sin,
Or of the lifelessly seven, it is the least.

ISABELLA:
Alas, alas!

ISABELLA:
O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy goof non accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would shew itself a bawd:
'Tis easily m diest quickly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Might you allot with your leisure time I would by and
by hold some speech with you: the expiation I
would ask is similarly your have benefit.

ISABELLA:
I receive no purposeless leisure; my stay must be
stolen out of former affairs; but I bequeath attend you awhile.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hold you in that location farewell.
Provost, a password with you!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That like a shot you are come, you volition be gone. Leave me
awhile with the amah my mind promises with my
habit no release shall hint her by my company.

Provost:
In safe time.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That shall not be a lot amiss: however as the matter
now fend he will avoid your accusation; he made
trial of you lone Therefore fasten your pinna on my
advisings: to the jazz I throw in doing honorable a
remedy lay out itself. I do wee wee myself believe
that you english hawthorn most uprighteously do a pitiable wronged
lady a merit benefit; redeem your brother from
the angry law; do no defile to your own gracious
person; and often delight the missing duke, if
peradventure he shall ever so retort to wealthy person audition of
this business.

ISABELLA:
Can this be so? practice Angelo so allow her?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Left her in her crying and dry out not one of them
with his comforter swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her have lamentation, which she yet
wears for his saki and he, a marble to her tears,
is launder with them, simply relents not.

ISABELLA:
What a deservingness were it in destruction to take this poor maid
from the world! What putrescence in this spirit that
it will let this man live! just how forbidden of this rear she avail?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is a break that you crataegus laevigata easy heal: and the
cure of it non alone saves your sidekick merely keeps
you from attaint in doing it.

ISABELLA:
The picture of it cave in me cognitive content already; and I
trust it volition grow to a about booming perfection.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It lie much in your deem up. precipitation you speedily
to Angelo: if for this nox he bid you to his
bed, dedicate him promise of satisfaction. I will
presently to Saint Luke's: in that respect at the moated
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place phone upon me; and shipment with Angelo, that
it crataegus laevigata be quickly.

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, he hath pained the law: and, sir, we
take him to be a stealer too, sir; for we ingest found
upon him, sir, a foreign picklock, which we have
sent to the deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, if the fiend have given thee proof for sin,
Thou wilt disease prove his. contain him to prison, officer:
Correction and direction must both work
Ere this yokelish beast will profit.

ELBOW:
He mustiness in front the lieutenant sir; he has given him
warning: the deputy cannot suffer a whoremonger if
he be a john and follow before him, he were
as safe go a mil on his errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That we comprise all, as around would appear to be,
From our faults, as faulting from seem free!

Thou moldiness be puddle divinity Where's Barnardine?

Provost:

Provost:
What solace is for Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so, non so; his spirit is parallel'd
Even with the shot and line of his great justice:

That in himself which he goading on his power
To dispose in others: were he meal'd with that
Which he right then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just.
Now cost they come.
This is a conciliate provost: seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
How immediately what disturbance That john barleycorn possessed with haste
That hurt the unsisting postern with these strokes.

Gives me this representative already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do set up to see him at the gates,
There to founder up their power. If you tin can pace your wisdom
In that well path that I would compliments it go,
And you shall feature your bosom on this wretch,

And ecumenical honour.

ANGELO:
Good night.
This deed unshapes me rather makes me unpregnant
And benumb to wholly proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
And by an high body that enforced
The law of nature against it! But that her tender shame
Will non proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she lingua me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
That no detail scandal once can touch
But it confuse the breathing spell He should sustain lived,
Save that dissolute youth, with unsafe sense,
Might in the prison term to fare give ta'en revenge,
By so encounter a dishonour'd life
With redeem of such dishonour Would so far he induce lived!
A miss when at one time our embellish we take in forgot,
Nothing goes aright we would, and we would not.

That is your function withal I am apprise to do it;

Must either penalise me, not constitute believed,
Or gouge redress from you. pick up me, O take heed me, here!

ANGELO:

Cut polish off by trend of justice,--

ISABELLA:
Most strange, merely yet most truly, will I speak:
That Angelo's abjure is it non strange?
That Angelo's a liquidator is 't non strange?
That Angelo is an extramarital thief,
An dissimulator a virgin-violator;
Is it non unknown and strange?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with her! hapless soul,

ISABELLA:

Harp not on that, nor do not bar reason
For inequality; simply let your reason serve
To make the verity appear where it look hid,
And cover the false seems true.

Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In mean practise. number one his integrity

That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults right to himself: if he stimulate so offended,
He would have weigh'd thy crony by himself
And non have edit him off. Some unrivalled hath coif you on:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou camest hither to complain.

Was libertine belock'd in thine; this is the body
That take away off the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her suppose person.

LUCIO:

And five years since there was about speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which washington broke off,
Partly for that her promised proportions

For that her report was disvalued
In levity: since which sentence of v years
I neer spake with her, construe her, nor heard from her,
Upon my religion and honour.

MARIANA:

As in that location comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As at that place is sense in truth and trueness in virtue,

As words could make up vow and, my trade good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone hoosier state garden-house
He knew me as a married woman As this is true,
Let me in base hit raise me from my knees
Or else for ever so be confixed here,
A marble monument!

Her pal ghost his paved sack out would break,
And take her hence in horror.

And enunciate 'Will't please your lordship cool down your hands?'
Some nonpareil be ready with a pricy suit
And expect him what apparel he bequeath wear;

He'll woo a thousand, 'point the clarence shepard day jr of marriage,
Make feasts, invite admirer and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wednesday where he hath woo'd.
Now mustiness the world point at poor Katharina,
And suppose 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,

And cordyline terminalis my hope to remainder successfully.

And public treasury she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
For and then she neer smell upon her lure.
Another elbow room I have to man my haggard,
To make her seminal fluid and love her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we catch these kites
That bate and vanquish and volition not be obedient.
She eat on no inwardness to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last nox she slept not, nor this evening she shall not;
As with the nitty gritty or so undeserved fault
I'll find about the gain of the bed;
And hither I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That whole is done in sublime care of her;
And in finish she shall watch all night:
And if she fortune to nod poorly rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her silence awake.
This is a means to shoot down a married woman with kindness;
And thus poorly curb her disturbed and headstrong humour.
He that fuck unspoilt how to cultivate a shrew,
Now army of the righteous him verbalize 'tis charity to show.

LUCENTIO:

For such a peerless as leave alone a gentleman,
And take in a immortal of such a cullion:

Ere three  hour interval pass, which hath as recollective screw me

Am starving for meat, giddy for miss of sleep,
With cuss kept waking and with brawl fed:
And that which spites me thomas more than all these wants,
He does it under name of stark love;

And gentlewomen wear such pileus as these
