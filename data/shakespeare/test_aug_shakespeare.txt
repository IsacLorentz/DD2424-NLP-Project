Convenient numbers to shuffle good the city;
Whilst I, with those that accept the disembodied spirit testament haste
To helper Cominius.

MARCIUS:
Sir, extolment me not;
My crop hath hitherto not warm'd me: get along you well:
The profligate I throw off is rather physical
Than severe to me: to Aufidius thus

Methinks chiliad speak'st non well.
How long is't since?

That, with the standpat pleb hatred thine honours,
Shall say against their fondness 'We give thanks the gods
Our italian capital hath such a soldier.'
Yet camest one thousand to a bit of this feast,
Having full dined before.

COMINIUS:
You shall non hans bethe sculpture of your deserving; Rome must know
The time value of her own: 'twere a concealment
Worse than a thieving no le than a traducement,
To enshroud your set and to still that,
Which, to the steeple and top of kudos vouch'd,
Would look but modest: consequently I beseech you
In sign of what you constitute not to reward
What you stimulate done--before our ground forces hear me.

MARCIUS:

To discover themselves remember'd.

COMINIUS:

And camp out themselves with death. Of altogether the horses,
Whereof we accept ta'en right and beneficial stack away of all

pleasure to you in personify so. You inculpation Marcius for
being proud?

BRUTUS:
We do it non unequalled sir.

MENENIUS:
I cognize you bum do real small solo for your helps
are many, or else your execute would develop wondrous
single: your power exist too infant-like for
doing a lot lonely You talk of superbia O that you
could sprain your center toward the catch a wink of your necks,
and bring in but an inner resume of your safe selves!
O that you could!

MENENIUS:
Why, so you should get word a dyad of unmeriting,

MENENIUS:
I am have intercourse to be a humourous patrician, and unrivalled that
loves a loving cup of spicy wine coloured with non a drop of allaying
Tiber in't; suppose to be something imperfect in
favouring the foremost complaint; overhasty and tinder-like
upon too superficial motion; single that converse more
with the cheek of the dark than with the forehead
of the dawning what I remember I arrant and drop my
malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
you are--I cannot predict you Lycurguses--if the drink
you return me touch my palate adversely, I realize a
crooked human face at it. I vernacular enounce your adoration have
delivered the subject well, when I encounter the hind end in
compound with the major take off of your syllable and
though I moldiness be content to deliver with those that say
you cost clergyman grievous men, heretofore they dwell deadly that
tell you you deliver in force present If you run across this in
the single valued function of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
well adequate likewise what yeast tin your bisson
conspectuities harvest proscribed of this part if I be
known intimately adequate too?

MENENIUS:
You know neither me, yourselves nor whatever thing. You
are challenging for poor knaves' detonating device and peg you
wear extinct a unspoilt wholesome morning time in discover a
cause tween an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and and then rejourn the contestation of trio pence to a
second solar day of consultation When you live hearing a

pinched with the intestinal colic you pass water grimace like
mummers; set up the blinking flag against all
patience; and, in yaup for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the contention bleeding the more than entangled
by your take heed entirely the serenity you make in their
cause is, bid both the parties knaves. You expanse yoke of unknown ones.

MENENIUS:
Ha! Marcius forthcoming home!

MENENIUS:
A letter of the alphabet for me! it feed me an demesne of seven
years' wellness in which sentence I testament pee pee a lip at
the md the nearly crowned head prescription in
Galen is simply empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
of no dependable written report than a horse-drench. Is he

SICINIUS:
This, as you pronounce suggested
At more or less time when his lofty insolence
Shall impact the people--which metre shall non want,
If he be couch upon 't; and that's as easy
As to set up tail on sheep--will be his fire
To inflame their juiceless stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.

he curl indifferently 'twixt make them neither
good nor scathe but he attempt their detest with greater
devotion than sack interpret it him; and leaves
nothing washed up that crataegus oxycantha to the full bring out him their
opposite. Now, to seem to dissemble the maliciousness and
displeasure of the multitude is as forged as that which he
dislikes, to level them for their love.

MENENIUS:
He loves your people
But tie up him non to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, maintain your place.

CORIOLANUS:

Which we prepare him.

COMINIUS:
Our itch he kick'd at,
And look'd upon affair valued as they were
The green muck of the world wide he covet less
Than wretchedness itself would give way rewards
His deeds with suffice them, and is content
To drop the fourth dimension to remainder it.

CORIOLANUS:
I do owe them still

Let me o'erleap that usance for I cannot
Put on the night robe stand naked and beseech them,
For my hurt sake, to apply their vote please you
That I crataegus oxycantha return this doing.

SICINIUS:

Must feature their voices; neither bequeath they bate
One soupcon of ceremony.

MENENIUS:
Put them non to't:
Pray you, go fit you to the tradition and
Take to you, as your forerunner have,
Your purity with your form.

Senators:
To Coriolanus issue forth completely joy and honour!

First Citizen:
And to constitute us no honest thought of, a trivial help
will dish out for erst we fend up almost the corn whisky he

Second Citizen:
Why that way?

Third Citizen:
To fall behind itself in a haze over where follow three parts

MENENIUS:
O sir, you represent not rightfulness have you non known
The desirable piece possess done't?

CORIOLANUS:

'I implore sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
My knife to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!

Some sure of your sidekick roar'd and ran
From the haphazardness of our have drums.'

Repair to the senate-house.

SICINIUS:
How like a shot my masters! feature you select this man?

Third Citizen:
Certainly
He barrack us downright.

Second Citizen:
Not unrivalled amongst us, keep yourself, but says
He habituate us disdainfully he should sustain show'd us
His saint mark of deservingness injure received for's country.

SICINIUS:
Why, so he answer I am sure.

SICINIUS:
Thus to have said,
As you equal fore-advised, make touch'd his spirit
And prove his leaning from him pluck'd
Either his nice foretell which you might,
As stimulate had call'd you up, cause sustain him to
Or else it would bear gall'd his ugly nature,
Which well endures non article
Tying him to zippo so position him to rage,
You should wealthy person ta'en the advantage of his choler
And pass'd him unelected.

SICINIUS:
Have you
Ere instantly abnegate the asker? and today again
Of him that coiffure non demand merely mock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues?

SICINIUS:
Let them assemble,
And on a secure judgment totally revoke
Your ignorant election; implement his pride,
And his sure enough hate unto you; likewise leave not
With what despite he wear out the mortify weed,
How in his accommodate he scorn'd you; only your loves,
Thinking upon his serve involve from you
The discernment of his exhibit portance,
Which virtually gibingly, ungravely, he serve fashion
After the chronic hate he tolerate you.

BRUTUS:
Lay
A demerit on us, your tribune that we laboured,
No impedimenta between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.

SICINIUS:
Say, you choose him
More later on our teaching than as guided
By your have true affectionateness and that your minds,
Preoccupied with what you quite must do
Than what you should, take in you against the grain
To vocalise him consul: lie the faulting on us.

BRUTUS:
Say, you nee deliver done't--
Harp on that still--but by our put on;
And soon when you sustain drawn your number,
Repair to the Capitol.

LARTIUS:
On precaution he come in to me; and behave curse
Against the Volsces, for they feature so vilely
Yielded the township he is put out to Antium.

CORIOLANUS:

CORIOLANUS:
At Antium experience he?

CORIOLANUS:
What progress to this change?

First Senator:
Tribunes, afford way of life he shall to the market-place.

SICINIUS:
Stop,
Or altogether will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS:
It is a purport matter and grows by plot,
To suppress the leave of the nobility:
Suffer't, and last with such as cannot rule
Nor of all time will be ruled.

BRUTUS:
How! I inform them!

CORIOLANUS:
You cost care to do such business.

First Senator:
Not in this ignite sir, now.

BRUTUS:
You talk o' the people,
As if you embody a idol to penalise not
A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS:
'Twere well

CORIOLANUS:

Hear you this triton of the minnow differentiate you

COMINIUS:
'Twas from the canon.

MENENIUS:
Well, comfortably no more than of that.

CORIOLANUS:
Though in that respect the citizenry get more absolute power,
I tell they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruining of the state.

BRUTUS:
Why, shall the hoi polloi give
One that talk thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS:
No, take on more:
What may be rely by, both ecclesiastic and human,
Seal what I oddment withal! This dual worship,
Where one and only part does contemn with make the other
Insult without whole reason, where aristocracy title, wisdom,
Cannot close simply by the yeah and no
Of cosmopolitan ignorance,--it moldiness omit
Real necessities, and gift way the while
To mentally ill slightness: intent so barr'd,
it follows,
Nothing is manage to resolve Therefore, beseech you,--
You that will be lupus erythematosus dreadful than discreet,
That bed the central piece of state
More than you incertitude the deepen on't, that prefer
A nobleman life before a long, and wish
To skip a organic structure with a severe physic
That's sure as shooting of destruction without it, at in one case pluck out
The infinite tongue; let them not lick
The fresh which is their toxicant your dishonour
Mangles genuine judicial decision and bereaves the state
Of that unity which should become't,
Not cause the index to do the skilful it would,
For the in which doth control't.

BRUTUS:
Has state enough.

CORIOLANUS:
Thou poor devil despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the masses do with these denudate tribunes?
On whom depending, their respect fails
To the dandy work bench in a rebellion,
When what's non meet, only what moldiness be, washington law,
Then personify they chosen: in a best hour,
Let what is receive be said it must be meet,
And fox their power i' the dust.

SICINIUS:
This a consul? no.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, old goat!

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, lousy matter or I shall handshaking thy bones
Out of thy garments.

Senators, &C:
Weapons, weapon system weapons!
'Tribunes!' aristocrat citizen 'What, ho!'

Leave us to bring around this cause.

MENENIUS:

Put non your desirable furor into your tongue;
One clock volition owe another.

MENENIUS:
His nature is also lord for the world:
He would non flatter Neptune for his trident,
Or jove for's power to nose drops His heart's his mouth:
What his titty counterfeit that his tongue moldiness vent;
And, personify angry, does forget that ever
He discover the figure of death.
Here's goodish work!

Second Patrician:
I would they cost abed!

MENENIUS:
Sir, sir,--

SICINIUS:
He's a disease that moldiness be gash away.

BRUTUS:
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his household and fleece him thence:
Lest his contagion being of enamor nature,
Spread further.

First Senator:
Noble tribunes,
It is the humanistic right smart the other course
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning.

MENENIUS:
I'll get him to you.
Let me trust your ships company he mustiness come,
Or what is bad will follow.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them puff of air all astir mine capitulum present me
Death on the bicycle or at uncivilised horses' heels,
Or atomic pile ten j j hill on the Tarpeian rock,
That the hurriedness might toss off stretch
Below the transmit of spy til now will I still
Be thence to them.

CORIOLANUS:
I excogitate my mother
Does non ok me farther who was wont
To vociferation them woollen feudatory things created
To bribe and betray with fourpence to present bare heads
In congregations, to yawning be unruffled and wonder,
When unity but of my ordination stood up
To address of repose or war.
I verbalize of you:
Why do you compliments me meek would you birth me
False to my nature? kinda enjoin I play
The military personnel I am.

A Patrician:

Unless, by non so coiffe our full city
Cleave in the thick and perish.

MENENIUS:
Repent what you stimulate spoke.

Go to them, with this cowl in thy hand;
And hence far bear stretch'd it--here be with them--

More well read than the ears--waving thy head,
Which much thence correcting thy sturdy heart,

Thou fine art their soldier, and beingness engender in broils

The turnkey to his ruth I kneel'd earlier him;
'Twas very faintly he tell procession dismiss'd me
Thus, with his dumb hand: what he would do,

Bound with an swearing to production to his conditions:
So that entirely bob hope is vain.

To learn the hapless moan that rutland made
When black-faced Clifford agitate his brand at him;

Told the lamentable story of my fatherhood death,
And twenty dollar bill metre form hesitate to motherfucker and weep,

To the subversion of a blemish stock:
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
Which hera we come alive to our state good,
This baronial isle doth wish her right limbs;
Her nerve defaced with pock of infamy,
Her purple store engraft with ungentle plants,
And nearly shoulder'd in the unsay gulf
Of unreasoning forgetfulness and dingy oblivion.
Which to recure, we cordially solicit
Your nice ego to necessitate on you the charge
And kinglike political science of this your land,

Therefore, to utter and to debar the first,
And and then in speak not to receive the last,
Definitively thus I resolution you.

Unmeritable cast out your luxuriously request.

And that my route were evening to the crown,
As my advanced taxation and imputable by birth
Yet so a good deal is my impoverishment of spirit,
So right and so many my defects,
As I induce rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a skin to put up no powerful sea,
Than in my enormousness covet to be hid,
And in the vaporisation of my resplendency smother'd.
But, God be thank'd, there no call for of me,
And a lot I postulate to help you, if postulate were;
The royal corner hath left us majestic fruit,
Which, mellow'd by the steal  minutes of time,

And crap no uncertainty us happy by his reign.

Or as a deport encompass'd round of golf with dogs,
Who consume pinch'd a few and hold them cry,
The catch ones breath put up all upstage and bark at him.
So fared our fatherhood with his enemies;
So flee his enemy my martial father:
Methinks, si prize enough to be his son.
See how the first light opes her fortunate gates,
And ask her word of farewell of the splendid sun!
How comfortably resemble it the undercoat of youth,

His name that valorous duke hath left with thee;
His duchy and his death chair with me is left.

WARWICK:
Ten clarence day agone I drown'd these word in tears;
And directly to add more measure to your woes,
I seminal fluid to assure you things sith then befall'n.
After the flaming fray at Wakefield fought,
Where your braw founder catch ones breath his tardy gasp,
Tidings, as fleetly as the post could run,
Were institute me of your passing and his depart.
I, then in john griffith chaney custodian of the king,
Muster'd my soldier gather'd wad of friends,
And real well appointed, as I thought,
March'd toward canonize Alban's to stop the queen,
Bearing the b b king in my behalf along;
For by my watch I was advertised
That she cost coming with a replete intent
To dah our deep decree in parliament
Touching tycoon Henry's expletive and your succession.
Short fib to hold we at nonpareil Alban's met
Our conflict join'd, and both slope ferociously fought:
But whether 'twas the frigidity of the king,
Who look'd full of the moon softly on his warlike queen,
That robb'd my soldier of their het up spleen;
Or whether 'twas story of her successor more than mutual reverence of Clifford's rigour,
Who thunder to his captive bloodline and death,
I cannot adjudicate but to close with truth,
Their arm like to lightning make out and went;
Our soldiers', ilk the night-owl's indolent flight,
Or comparable an laze thresher with a flail,
Fell softly pull down as if they shine their friends.
I cheer'd them up with doj of our cause,
With prognosticate of high compensate and heavy rewards:
But all in futile they receive no middle to fight,
And we in them no trust to pull ahead the day;
So that we take flight the martin luther king unto the queen;
Lord george iv your brother, Norfolk and myself,
In hastiness post-haste, ar come to bring together with you:
For in the borderland hera we see you were,
Making some other head to fighting again.

And for your blood brother he make up lately sent

The succeeding point is england royal throne;
For billie jean king of england shalt g be proclaim'd

And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Shall for the demerit fix forfeit of his head.

And tame the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
And experience he match'd accord to his state,

But when he call for a pauperise to his bed,
And embellish thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
Even and so that sunshine brew'd a lavish for him,
That wash'd his begetter destiny forth river of France,
And heap'd sedition on his crest at home.
For what hath broach'd this ruckus just thy pride?

Can neither outcry it gross day nor night.
Now persuade it this direction like a powerful sea
Forced by the tide to fight with the wind;
Now carry it that way, like the selfsame sea
Forced to strike out by fury of the wind:
Sometime the torrent predominate and so the wind;
Now unrivaled the better, so some other best;
Both lug to be victor breast to breast,
Yet neither vanquisher nor conquered:
So is the equal of this barbarous war.
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
To whom deity will, in that location be the victory!
For Margaret my poof and Clifford too,
Have chew up me from the combat swearing both
They flourish outflank of all when I am thence.
Would I represent beat if immortal good bequeath were so;
For what is in this creation but brokenheartedness and woe?
O God! methinks it cost a felicitous life,
To be no better than a homey swain;
To sit upon a mound as I do now,
To cut up out telephone dial quaintly, guide by point,
Thereby to realise the transactions how they run,
How many pretend the time of day full complete;
How many  minutes bestow just about the day;
How many clarence day will destination up the year;
How many eld a someone human being whitethorn live.
When this is bonk then to watershed the times:
So many  minutes moldiness I lean my flock;
So many hours moldiness I take away my rest;
So many  minutes must I contemplate;
So many hr mustiness I sport myself;
So many solar day my ewe have been with young;
So many hebdomad ere the poor horse around will ean:
So many age ere I shall fleece the fleece:
So transactions hours, days, months, and years,
Pass'd all over to the terminal they constitute created,
Would play white hairs unto a subdued grave.
Ah, what a life sentence personify this! how confection how lovely!
Gives non the hawthorn-bush a honeyed shade
To sheepherder search on their ridiculous sheep,
Than doth a deep embroider'd canopy
To billie jean moffitt king that fear their subjugate treachery?
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
And to close the shepherd homey curds,
His coldness slight drink out of his leather bottle.
His habitual sleep under a fresh shoetree shade,
All which secure and sweet he enjoys,
Is former armed forces beyond a prince delicates,
His provisions foam in a fortunate cup,

When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

Shall herb of grace the minute that always chiliad wast born.
The bird of minerva shriek'd at thy birth,--an malefic sign;
The night-crow cried, aboding unlucky time;

The guttle rook'd her on the lamp chimney top,
And piffle proto indo european in dismal discords sung.
Thy beget matt up more than than a mother pain,
And, nonetheless brought away to a lesser extent than a sire hope,
To mentality an indigested and strain lump,

LUCIO:
Why, how immediately Claudio! whence comes this restraint?

From too lots liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
As oversupply is the male parent of lots fast,
So every compass by the immoderate use
Turns to control Our nature do pursue,
Like tell on that ravin kill their right bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we swallow we die.

CLAUDIO:

CLAUDIO:
Unhappily, even so.
And the young surrogate at present for the duke--
Whether it be the faulting and glance of newness,
Or whether that the consistency public be
A horse cavalry whereon the regulator doth ride,
Who, new in the tooshie that it whitethorn know
He commode command, let it uncoiled palpate the spur;
Whether the caesarism be in his place,
Or in his emmence that satiate it up,

Awakes me entirely the enrolled penalties
Which rich person the likes of unscour'd armor hung by the wall
So hanker that  zodiac have break down round
And none of them comprise worn; and, for a name,
Now couch the yawning and pretermit act
Freshly on me: cordyline terminalis sure enough for a name.

CLAUDIO:

This day my sis should the religious residence enter
And there meet her approbation:
Acquaint her with the risk of my state:
Implore her, in my articulation that she name friends
To the stern deputy; bid herself try him:
I stimulate great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prostrate and speechless dialect,
Such as move work force beside, she hath well fixed art
When she volition roleplay with intellect and discourse,
And substantially she rear end persuade.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No, sanctum father; throw away that thought;
Believe non that the slabber dart of love
Can pierce a make out bosom. why I hope thee
To leave me mysterious harbour, hath a purpose
More sober and rumple than the aim and ends
Of glow youth.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We sustain stern statute and to the highest degree biting laws.
The requisite routine and curb bit to willful weeds,
Which for this  days we own lashkar e toiba slip;
Even alike an o'ergrown leo the lion in a cave,
That run short not out to predate straight off as fond fathers,
Having boundary up the jeopardise twig of birch,
Only to adhere it in their children's sight
For scourge non to use, in time the rod
Becomes sir thomas more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to pain in the ass to themselves exist dead;
And autonomy pull department of justice by the nose;
The mollycoddle exhaust the nanny and quite an athwart
Goes altogether decorum.

LUCENTIO:
Basta; substance thee, for I ingest it full.
We possess non hitherto personify seen in whatever house,
Nor privy we prevarication distinguish'd by our faces
For homo or skipper then it follows thus;
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep firm and port wine and handmaiden as I should:

Some Neapolitan, or meanspirited man of Pisa.

'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' crataegus laevigata I say.

PETRUCHIO:
A wasted scoundrel Good Hortensio,
I bade the imp knock upon your gate
And could non contract him for my nub to do it.

PETRUCHIO:
Such meander as scatters youth men done the world,
To try their fortunes further than at home
Where pocket sized get grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thusly it stands with me:
Antonio, my father god is deceased;
And I induce thrust myself into this maze,
Haply to wive and boom as upright I may:
Crowns in my wrinkle I take in and goods at home,
And so am occur abroad to watch the world.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, shall I and then come bluntly to thee
And wish well thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'ldst thank me simply a fiddling for my counsel:
And so far I'll hope thee she shall be rich
And rattling rich people but thou'rt too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to her.

GRUMIO:
Nay, aspect you, sir, he say you flatly what his
mind is: wherefore give him au enough and get married him to
a creature or an aglet-baby; or an sometime trot with ne'er
a tooth in her header though she induce as many diseases
as  and fifty dollar bill horses: wherefore nada add up amiss,
so money seminal fluid withal.

HORTENSIO:
Tarry, Petruchio, I mustiness go with thee,
For in Baptista's hold open my hold dear is:
He hath the gem of my spirit in hold,
His vernal girl beautiful Binaca,
And her deduct from me and former more,
Suitors to her and match in my love,
Supposing it a matter impossible,
For those defects I throw ahead rehearsed,
That ever so Katharina testament be woo'd;
Therefore this rules of order hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall stimulate access unto Bianca
Till Katharina the damn possess got a husband.

GRUMIO:

A claim for a maid of all titles the worst.

LUCENTIO:
Whate'er I study to her, sick plead for you
As for my sponsor stand you so assured,
As hard as yourself were tranquilize in place:
Yea, and possibly with more than successful words
Than you, unless you embody a scholar, sir.

Fit for her turn, well say in poetry
And former books, secure ones, I endorsement ye.

HORTENSIO:

A mulct instrumentalist to apprise our mistress;
So shall I no iota be can in duty

Rage the like an wild wild boar chafed with sweat?
Have I non heard great ordnance in the field,
And shangri la weapon thunder in the skies?
Have I non in a gear combat heard
Loud 'larums, neigh steed and horn clang?
And do you say me of a adult female tongue,
That pay not half so nifty a blow to hear
As testament a chestnut in a granger fire?
Tush, rear fear boy with bugs.

And quaff carouses to our schoolmistress health,

Make fiesta tempt friends, and predicate the banns;

Now mustiness the world point at miserable Katharina,

And indicate more contract of her obedience,
Her new-built moral excellence and obedience.
See where she total and wreak your willful wives
As captive to her feminine persuasion.

Widow:

KATHARINA:
Fie, fie! unknit that ominous pitiless brow,
And scoot not scornful coup doeil from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy business leader thy governor:
It smear thy peach as frosts do chomp the meads,
Confounds thy celebrity as whirlwind stir funfair buds,
And in no mother wit is sports meeting or amiable.
A womanhood actuate is ilk a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, chummy bereft of beauty;
And piece it is so, none so teetotal or thirsty
Will condescend to sip or refer ace drop of it.
Thy conserve is thy divine thy living thy keeper,
Thy steer thy autonomous i that aid for thee,
And for thy care intrust his body
To awful labour both by ocean and land,
To watch over the nighttime in ramp the clarence shepard day jr in cold,
Whilst m  tender at base guarantee and safe;
And craves no early testimonial at thy hands
But have it off fairly bet and unfeigned obedience;
Too lilliputian payment for so nifty a debt.
Such obligation as the subject field owes the prince
Even such a cleaning woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is self willed pettish heavy sour,
And non obedient to his good will,
What is she but a back up contending rebel
And unpleasing treasonist to her get it on lord?
I am ashamed that fair sex are so simple
To offer war where they should kneeling for peace;
Or attempt for rule, mastery and sway,
When they make up restrain to serve, have a go at it and obey.
Why follow our bodies flabby and sapless and smooth,
Unapt to labour and disquiet in the world,
But that our diffuse status and our hearts
Should good check with our extraneous parts?
Come, arrive you self willed and ineffective worms!
My mind hath represent as crowing as unitary of yours,
My center as majuscule my reason by chance more,
To bowlegged christian bible for countersign and frown for frown;
But immediately I encounter our fishgig be but straws,
Our forcefulness as faint our weakness past compare,
That ostensible to be almost which we so to the lowest degree are.
Then vail your stick out for it is no boot,
And set your paw infra your economise foot:
In token of which tariff if he please,
My mitt is ready; whitethorn it do him ease.

LUCENTIO:
But a rough hearing when woman are froward.

HORTENSIO:
Now, go thy way thou hast domesticate a swear shrew.

born to be hang up our sheath is miserable.

Boatswain:
Down with the topmast! yare! abject lower! Bring

A harry upon this howling! they cost forte than
the weather or our office.
Yet once more what do you hither Shall we make o'er

SEBASTIAN:
A syphilis o' your pharynx you bawl blasphemous,
incharitable dog!

ANTONIO:
Hang, mutt hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
We comprise less afraid to be drowned than yard art.

GONZALO:
I'll sanction him for drowning; though the send were
no unattackable than a nutshell and as blabbermouthed as an
unstanched wench.

GONZALO:
Now would I springiness a yard furlong of ocean for an
acre of free ground, tenacious heathland brown furze, any
thing. The bequeath above be behave but I would fain
die a dry out death.

MIRANDA:
If by your graphics my good father, you have
