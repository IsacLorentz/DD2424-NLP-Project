All:
Speak, speak.

First Citizen:
You are all resolved kind of to die than to famish?

First Citizen:
First, you eff Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

First Citizen:
Let us pop him, and we'll have corn at our possess price.
Is't a verdict?

All:
No more talking on't; allow it be done: away, away!

Second Citizen:
One give and take good citizens.

First Citizen:
We are accounted pathetic citizens, the patricians good.
What authority excess on would relieve us: if they
would relent us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we mightiness guess they relieved us humanely;
but they recall we are too dear: the scantness that
afflicts us, the object of our wretchedness is as an
inventory to particularise their teemingness our
sufferance is a gain to them allow us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we turn rakes: for the gods know I
speak this in thirst for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

All:
Against him offset he's a very dog to the commonalty.

First Citizen:
Very considerably and could be content to yield him good
report fort, but that he yield himself with being proud.

First Citizen:
I articulate unto you, what he hath make famously, he did
it to that close though soft-conscienced men can be
content to sound out it was for his country he behave it to
please his mother and to be part proud; which he
is, even till the el of his virtue.

Second Citizen:
What he cannot service in his nature, you account a
vice in him. You mustiness in no way say he is covetous.

All:
Come, come.

First Citizen:
Soft! world health organization comes here?

Second Citizen:
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; unrivaled that hath always loved
the people.

First Citizen:
He's ace honest enough: would all the eternal rest were so!

First Citizen:
Our business is non unknown to the senate; they have
had glimmer this fortnight what we intend to do,
which nowadays we'll show 'em in deeds. They state poor
suitors have strong breaths: they shall recognize we
have strong arms too.

MENENIUS:
Why, masters, my estimable friends, mine honest neighbours,
Will you untie yourselves?

First Citizen:
We cannot, sir, we live undone already.

MENENIUS:
I tell you, friends, near charitable care
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Your put up in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the promised land with your staves as lift them
Against the roman catholic state, whose course will on
The direction it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more than strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your obstructer For the dearth,
The gods, not the blue blood make it, and
Your knees to them, non arms, must help. Alack,
You are channelise by calamity
Thither where more attends you, and you slander
The helm o' the state, who care for you care fathers,
When you curse them as enemies.

First Citizen:
Care for us! avowedly indeed! They ne'er cared for us
yet: get us to famish, and their store-houses
crammed with ingrain make edicts for usury, to
support usurer repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the fertile and provide more
piercing statutes daily, to mountain chain up and restrain
the poor. If the state of war eat us not up, they leave and
there's all the love they conduct us.

MENENIUS:
Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
Or be incriminate of folly. I shall tell you
A middling tale: it may be you suffer heard it;
But, since it serves my design I will venture
To stale 't a fiddling more.

First Citizen:
Well, I'll hear it, sir: all the same you must not think to
fob turned our disgrace with a tale: just an 't please
you, deliver.

MENENIUS:
There was a clock time when all the body's members
Rebell'd against the paunch thus accused it:
That only like a disconnection it did remain
I' the midst o' the physical structure idle and unactive,
Still cupboarding the viand, neer bearing
Like labour with the rest, where the early instruments
Did see and hear, devise, teach walk, feel,
And, mutually participate, did minister
Unto the appetency and affection common
Of the whole eubstance The belly answer'd--

First Citizen:
Well, sir, what respond made the belly?

First Citizen:
Your belly's resolve What!
The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
The pleader heart, the arm our soldier,
Our steed the ramification the tongue our trumpeter.
With other muniments and fiddling helps
In this our fabric, if that they--

MENENIUS:
What then?
'Fore me, this comrade speaks! What then? what then?

First Citizen:
Should by the phalacrocorax carbo belly be restrain'd,
Who is the cesspit o' the body,--

MENENIUS:
Well, what then?

First Citizen:
The early agents, if they did complain,
What could the stomach answer?

MENENIUS:
I will tell you
If you'll confer a small--of what you have little--
Patience for a while you'll hear the belly's answer.

First Citizen:
Ye're longsighted about it.

MENENIUS:
Note me this, good friend;
Your well nigh grave belly was deliberate,
Not rash ilk his accusers, and thus answer'd:
'True is it, my integrated friends,' quoth he,
'That I receive the oecumenical food at first,
Which you do survive upon; and fit it is,
Because I am the store and the shop
Of the whole trunk but, if you do remember,
I send out it through the rivers of your blood,
Even to the courtyard the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
And, done the cranks and offices of man,
The warm nerves and small inferior veins
From me get that natural competency
Whereby they live: and though that whole at once,
You, my good friends,'--this enjoin the belly, mark me,--

First Citizen:
Ay, sir; wellspring well.

First Citizen:
It was an answer: how practice you this?

First Citizen:
I the great toenail why the great toe?

MENENIUS:
For that, be one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this about wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
Thou rapscallion that art worst in blood to run,
Lead'st number one to win some vantage.
But make you cook your stiff bats and clubs:
Rome and her denounce are at the point of battle;
The single side must have bale.
Hail, noble Marcius!

MARCIUS:
Thanks. What's the weigh you dissentious rogues,
That, rubbing the short itch of your opinion,
Make yourselves scabs?

First Citizen:
We give birth ever your good word.

MARCIUS:
He that leave give good words to thee testament flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would you ingest you curs,
That like nor peace nor warfare the one affrights you,
The other brand you proud. He that trusts to you,
Where he should find out you lions, finds you hares;
Where confuse geese: you are no surer, no,
Than is the char of fire upon the ice,
Or hailstone in the sunday Your virtue is
To make him desirable whose offence subdues him
And curse that doj did it.
Who deserves greatness
Deserves your detest and your affections are
A sick valet appetite, who desires most that
Which would step up his evil. He that depends
Upon your party favor swims with fins of lead
And hew down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! cartel Ye?
With every minute you do interchange a mind,
And call him noble that constitute now your hate,
Him vile that embody your garland. What's the matter,
That in these various places of the city
You cry against the imposing senate, who,
Under the gods, keep you in fear which else
Would feed on one some other What's their seeking?

MENENIUS:
For corn at their have rates; whereof, they say,
The city is swell stored.

MENENIUS:
Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
For though copiously they lack discretion,
Yet are they go past cowardly. But, I beseech you,
What enjoin the other troop?

MARCIUS:
They are dissolved: fall 'em!
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd onward proverbs,
That hunger broke stone walls, that dog must eat,
That meat was made for rima oris that the gods sent not
Corn for the racy men only: with these shreds
They give vent their complainings; which being answer'd,
And a prayer granted them, a strange one--
To transgress the heart of generosity,
And make sheer power look pale--they threw their caps
As they would cling them on the horns o' the moon,
Shouting their emulation.

MENENIUS:
What is concede them?

MARCIUS:
Five tribunes to defend their uncouth wisdoms,
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Sicinius Velutus, and I fuck not--'Sdeath!
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
Ere so prevail'd with me: it testament in time
Win upon power and cast forth greater themes
For insurrection's arguing.

MENENIUS:
This is strange.

MARCIUS:
Go, flummox you home, you fragments!

Messenger:
Where's Caius Marcius?

MARCIUS:
Here: what's the matter?

First Senator:
Marcius, cordyline terminalis true that you have lately enjoin us;
The Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS:
They induce a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that will redact you to 't.
I sin in envy his nobility,
And were I any affair but what I am,
I would bid me only he.

MARCIUS:
Were half to one half the world by the ears and he.
Upon my political party I'ld revolt to make
Only my state of war with him: he is a lion
That I am gallant to hunt.

MARCIUS:
Sir, it is;
And I am invariant Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me at one time more strike at Tullus' face.
What, artistic production thou stiff? stand'st out?

MENENIUS:
O, true-bred!

First Senator:
Your companionship to the Capitol; where, I know,
Our heavy friends attend us.

TITUS:

COMINIUS:
Noble Marcius!

MARCIUS:
Nay, let them follow:
The Volsces possess much corn; take these rats thither
To gnaw at their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Your valour position well forth: pray, follow.

BRUTUS:
Mark'd you his mouth and eyes?

SICINIUS:
Nay. but his taunts.

BRUTUS:
Being proceed he will not spare to arm the gods.

BRUTUS:
The present wars devour him: he is grown
Too gallant to be so valiant.

SICINIUS:
Such a nature,
Tickled with skilful success, disdains the shadow
Which he step on at noon: but I do wonder
His gall can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.

BRUTUS:
Fame, at the which he aims,
In whom already atomic number  well graced, can not
Better be keep back nor more attain'd than by
A property below the first: for what miscarries
Shall be the full general fault, though he perform
To the maximum of a man, and giddy censure
Will and so cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Had digest the business!'

BRUTUS:
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours follow to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them non and all his faults
To Marcius shall be abide by though indeed
In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS:
Let's thence and hear
How the dispatch is take a shit and in what fashion,
More than his uniqueness he goes
Upon this present action.

BRUTUS:
Lets along.

First Senator:
So, your ruling is, Aufidius,
That they of Rome represent entered in our counsels
And know how we proceed.

AUFIDIUS:
Is it non yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state,
That could be add to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? cordyline terminalis not four days gone
Since I pick up thence; these are the words: I think
I take in the letter here; yes, here it is.
'They hold press'd a power, but it is non known
Whether for east or west: the paucity is great;
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
Cominius, Marcius your erstwhile enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hat than of you,
And Titus Lartius, a near valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither titanium bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'

First Senator:
Our ground forces in the field
We never yet piddle doubt but Rome was ready
To do us.

Second Senator:
Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; step on it you to your bands:
Let us unaccompanied to guard Corioli:
If they set dispirited before 's, for the remove
Bring your regular army but, I think, you'll find
They've non prepared for us.

AUFIDIUS:
O, doubt not that;
I talk from certainties. Nay, more,
Some parcels of their top executive are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave of absence your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius take a chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall always strike
Till one can do no more.

AUFIDIUS:
And bread and butter your honours safe!

First Senator:
Farewell.

All:
Farewell.

VOLUMNIA:
I pray you, girl sing; or express yourself in a
more well heeled sort: if my son were my conserve I
should freelier rejoice in that absence seizure wherein he
won honour than in the embracement of his bed where
he would express most love. When yet he personify but
tender-bodied and the only son of my uterus when
youth with comeliness plucked all regard his way, when
for a day of magnate entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hr from her beholding, I, considering
how observe would become such a person. that it was
no undecomposed than picture-like to hang by the paries if
renown made it not stir, cost pleased to let him seek
danger where he embody like to find fame. To a cruel
war I station him; from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak tree I tell thee, daughter, I take form not
more in joy at first get a line he was a man-child
than now in start seeing he had proved himself a
man.

VIRGILIA:
But have got he died in the business, dame how then?

VOLUMNIA:
Then his good report should bear been my son; I
therein would bear found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: throw I a dozen sons, each in my love
alike and none to a lesser extent dear than thine and my good
Marcius, I deliver rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than unmatched voluptuously surfeit out of action.

Gentlewoman:
Madam, the peeress Valeria is come to visit you.

VIRGILIA:
Beseech you, sacrifice me leave to retire myself.

VOLUMNIA:
Indeed, you shall not.
Methinks I find out hither your husband's drum,
See him deplume Aufidius down by the hair,
As fry from a bear, the Volsces cast out him:
Methinks I see him stamp frankincense and call thus:
'Come on, you coward you were got in fear,
Though you represent born in Rome:' his bloody brow
With his mail'd pass then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a daddy longlegs that's task'd to mow
Or all or recede his hire.

VIRGILIA:
His bloody brow! O jove no blood!

VIRGILIA:
Heavens bless my lord from cut down Aufidius!

VOLUMNIA:
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
And trample upon his neck.

VALERIA:
My ladies both, honest day to you.

VALERIA:
How do you both? you make up manifest house-keepers.
What are you sewing hither A fine spot, in good
faith. How practice your little son?

VALERIA:
O' my word, the father son: I'll swear,'tis a
very pretty male child O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
Wednesday one half an hour together: has such a
confirmed phiz I saw him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he watch it, he let it go
again; and afterwards it again; and over and all over he
comes, and again; catched it once again or whether his
fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he practice so set his
teeth and tear it; O, I indorsement it, how he mammocked
it!

VOLUMNIA:
One on 's male parent moods.

VALERIA:
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

VIRGILIA:
No, expert madam; I will not out of doors.

VALERIA:
Not come out of the closet of doors!

VOLUMNIA:
She shall, she shall.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, no, by your longanimity I'll not over the
threshold till my almighty return from the wars.

VIRGILIA:
I will wishing her speedy strength, and visit her with
my supplicant but I cannot go thither.

VIRGILIA:
'Tis non to save labour, nor that I deficiency love.

VALERIA:
You would be another Penelope: withal they say, all
the yarn she birl in Ulysses' absence did but fill
Ithaca replete of moths. Come; I would your cambric
were reasonable as your finger, that you mightiness leave
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.

VALERIA:
In true statement la, go with me; and poorly tell you
excellent news of your husband.

VIRGILIA:
O, just madam, there can be none yet.

VIRGILIA:
Indeed, madam?

VALERIA:
In businesslike it's true; I heard a senator talk it.
Thus it is: the Volsces sustain an army forth; against
whom Cominius the world wide is gone, with one part of
our roman type power: your lord and Titus Lartius cost set
down before their city Corioli; they zilch doubt
prevailing and to make it legal brief wars. This is true,
on mine respect and so, I pray, go with us.

VOLUMNIA:
Let her unique lady: as she is now, she leave but
disease our better mirth.

VALERIA:
In troth, I suppose she would. Fare you well, then.
Come, upright sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
solemness tabu o' door. and go along with us.

VALERIA:
Well, so farewell.

MARCIUS:
Yonder comes news. A wager they deliver met.

LARTIUS:
My horse to yours, no.

MARCIUS:
'Tis done.

LARTIUS:
Agreed.

Messenger:
They lie in in view; but have not verbalise as yet.

MARCIUS:
I'll buy him of you.

LARTIUS:
No, ill nor sell nor give him: contribute you him I will
For half a one hundred years. Summon the town.

MARCIUS:
How far slay lie these armies?

Messenger:
Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS:
Then shall we learn their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, blemish I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoke swords may march from hence,
To assistance our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
Tutus Aufidius, is he inside your walls?

First Senator:
No, nor a world that fears you less than he,
That's less than a little.
Hark! our drums
Are land forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
Rather than they shall cypriot pound us up: our gates,
Which yet look shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll exposed of themselves.
Hark you. far off!
There is Aufidius; heel what work he makes
Amongst your cohere army.

MARCIUS:
O, they are at it!

LARTIUS:
Their racket be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

MARCIUS:
They reverence us not, but issue forth their city.
Now pose your shields before your hearts, and fight
With center more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:
They do condescension us much beyond our thoughts,
Which name me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
He that go to bed I'll take him for a Volsce,
And he shall sense mine edge.

MARCIUS:
All the contagion of the to the south light on you,
You shames of roma you herd of--Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you crataegus laevigata be abhorr'd
Further than seen and matchless infect another
Against the wind a geographical mile You souls of geese,
That bear the physical body of men, how have you run
From knuckle down that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All bruise behind; backs red, and faces pale
With fledge and agued fear! Mend and shoot down home,
Or, by the fires of nirvana I'll leave the foe
And make my war on you: look to't: come on;
If you'll tolerate fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our ditch followed.
So, now the gates are ope: at once prove good seconds:
'Tis for the follower fortune widens them,
Not for the broadside mark me, and do the like.

First Soldier:
Fool-hardiness; non I.

Second Soldier:
Nor I.

First Soldier:
See, they take shut him in.

All:
To the pot, I sanction him.

LARTIUS:
What is become of Marcius?

All:
Slain, sir, doubtless.

First Soldier:
Following the flier at the very heels,
With them he go into who, upon the sudden,
Clapp'd to their bill gates he is himself alone,
To answer completely the city.

LARTIUS:
O noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares his reasonless sword,
And, when it bows, stands up. yard art left, Marcius:
A carbuncle entire, as enceinte as thou art,
Were not so plentiful a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
Even to Cato's bid not fierce and terrible
Only in stroke but, with thy grim looks and
The thunder-like percussion section of thy sounds,
Thou madst thine enemy shake, as if the world
Were feverish and did tremble.

First Soldier:
Look, sir.

LARTIUS:
O,'tis Marcius!
Let's bring him off, or make remain alike.

First Roman:
This volition I carry to Rome.

Second Roman:
And I this.

Third Roman:
A murrain on't! I hire this for silver.

MARCIUS:
See here these mover that do prize their hours
At a crack'd dram Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublet that hangmen would
Bury with those that fatigue them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the scrap be done, pack up: down with them!
And hearken what noise the general makes! To him!
There is the serviceman of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Piercing our romans then, valiant Titus, take
Convenient numbers to create good the city;
Whilst I, with those that take in the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.

MARCIUS:
Sir, extolment me not;
My work hath yet non warm'd me: fare you well:
The rakehell I drop is rather physical
Than unsafe to me: to Aufidius thus
I volition appear, and fight.

LARTIUS:
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall bass in love with thee; and her keen charms
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
Prosperity be thy page!

MARCIUS:
Thy protagonist no less
Than those she placeth high So, farewell.

LARTIUS:
Thou worthiest Marcius!
Go, sound thy horn in the market-place;
Call thither all the police officer o' the town,
Where they shall bed our mind: away!

COMINIUS:
Breathe you, my friend well fought;
we are come off
Like roman neither foolish in our stands,
Nor fearful in retire: believe me, sirs,
We shall be burden again. Whiles we have struck,
By interim and conveying gusts we have heard
The buck of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
Lead their achiever as we wish our own,
That both our great power with smiling
fronts encountering,
May give you grateful sacrifice.
Thy news?

Messenger:
The citizens of Corioli rich person issued,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
I adage our party to their trenches driven,
And so I came away.

COMINIUS:
Though thou speak'st truth,
Methinks k speak'st not well.
How long is't since?

Messenger:
Above an minute my lord.

Messenger:
Spies of the Volsces
Held me in dog that I was forced to wheel
Three or quaternion miles about, else had I, sir,
Half an  minutes since brought my report.

COMINIUS:
Who's yonder,
That doe appear as he were flay'd? O gods
He have the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time see him thus.

COMINIUS:
The shepherd knows not hell dust from a tabour
More than I sleep with the sound of Marcius' tongue
From every mean man.

MARCIUS:
Come I too late?

COMINIUS:
Ay, if you come in not in the blood of others,
But clothed in your own.

COMINIUS:
Flower of warriors,
How is it with epistle of paul the apostle to titus Lartius?

MARCIUS:
As with a man busied nearly decrees:
Condemning some to death, and just about to exile;
Ransoming him, or pitying, imperil the other;
Holding Corioli in the bring up of Rome,
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To permit him slip at will.

COMINIUS:
But how prevail'd you?

MARCIUS:
Will the prison term serve to tell? I do non think.
Where is the enemy? are you divine o' the field?
If not, why finish you till you are so?

COMINIUS:
Marcius,
We let at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to get ahead our purpose.

MARCIUS:
How lies their battle? lie with you on which side
They have identify their men of trust?

MARCIUS:
I do bid you,
By all the battles wherein we deliver fought,
By the blood we have drop together, by the vows
We have wee to endure friends, that you directly
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that you non delay the present, but,
Filling the publicise with swords advanced and darts,
We testify this very hour.

LARTIUS:
So, let the embrasure be guarded: keep your duties,
As I receive set them down. If I do direct dispatch
Those centuries to our aid: the residuum will serve
For a short holding: if we miss the field,
We cannot keep the town.

Lieutenant:
Fear non our care, sir.

LARTIUS:
Hence, and shut your logic gate upon's.
Our guider, come; to the roman camp conduct us.

AUFIDIUS:
We hate alike:
Not Afric own a serpent I abhor
More than thy celebrity and envy. Fix thy foot.

AUFIDIUS:
If I vanish Marcius,
Holloa me like a hare.

MARCIUS:
Within these ternion hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And pee what work I pleased: 'tis non my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy business leader to the highest.

LARTIUS:
O general,
Here is the steed, we the caparison:
Hadst g beheld--

MARCIUS:
Pray now, no more: my mother,
Who give a charter to extol her blood,
When she serve praise me grieves me. I own done
As you have done; that's what I give the sack induced
As you have been; that's for my country:
He that ingest but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.

COMINIUS:
You shall non be
The grave of your deserving; italian capital must know
The value of her ain 'twere a concealment
Worse than a thievery no less than a traducement,
To cover your doings; and to silence that,
Which, to the steeple and top of praises vouch'd,
Would appear but modest: therefore, I beseech you
In gestural of what you are, not to reward
What you take in done--before our army hear me.

MARCIUS:
I wealthy person some wounds upon me, and they smart
To learn themselves remember'd.

COMINIUS:
Should they not,
Well might they maturate 'gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves with expiry Of all the horses,
Whereof we make ta'en good and good store, of all
The prize in this field achieved and city,
We show you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the usual distribution, at
Your only choice.

MARCIUS:
I thank you, general;
But cannot attain my heart consent to take
A buy to pay my sword: I do food waste it;
And stand upon my common start with those
That have beheld the doing.

MARCIUS:
May these lapp instruments, which you profane,
Never sound more than when drums and trumpets shall
I' the field of battle prove flatterers, let courts and city be
Made all of false-faced soothing!
When sword grows soft as the parasite's silk,
Let him be draw a coverture for the wars!
No to a greater extent I say! For that I accept not wash'd
My nose that bled, or foil'd around debile wretch.--
Which, without note, here's many else accept done,--
You shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical;
As if I be intimate my little should be dieted
In praise sauced with lies.

All:
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS:
I bequeath go wash;
And when my face is sightly you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I give thanks you.
I mean to stride your steed, and at completely times
To undercrest your good addition
To the equity of my power.

COMINIUS:
So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do placidity us, we will write
To Rome of our succeeder You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli rachis send us to Rome
The best, with whom we crataegus oxycantha articulate,
For their own good and ours.

LARTIUS:
I shall, my lord.

CORIOLANUS:
The idol begin to mock me. I, that now
Refused to the highest degree princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my almighty general.

COMINIUS:
Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?

CORIOLANUS:
I former lay here in Corioli
At a poor people man's house; he used me kindly:
He shout out to me; I saw him prisoner;
But so Aufidius was within my view,
And anger o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
To ease up my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS:
O, well begg'd!
Were he the blunderer of my son, he should
Be unloose as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

LARTIUS:
Marcius, his name?

CORIOLANUS:
By jove forgot.
I am weary; yea, my retentiveness is tired.
Have we no wine here?

AUFIDIUS:
The ithiel town is ta'en!

First Soldier:
He's the devil.

AUFIDIUS:
Bolder, though non so subtle. My valour's poison'd
With only when suffering stain by him; for him
Shall take flight out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being bare sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The supplicant of priests nor times of sacrifice,
Embarquements completely of fury, shall lift up
Their crappy privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I ascertain him, were it
At home, upon my brother guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canyon would I
Wash my fierce hand hoosier state heart. Go you to the city;
Learn how ti held; and what they are that must
Be hostage for Rome.

AUFIDIUS:
I am attended at the cypress tree grove: I pray you--
'Tis south the urban center mills--bring me word thither
How the populace goes, that to the pace of it
I crataegus laevigata spur on my journey.

MENENIUS:
The augurer differentiate me we shall have news to-night.

BRUTUS:
Good or bad?

SICINIUS:
Nature learn beasts to know their friends.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, world health organization does the wolf love?

Both:
Well, sir.

BRUTUS:
He's inadequate in no one fault, but put in with all.

BRUTUS:
And topping all others in boasting.

MENENIUS:
This is unusual now: do you two know how you are
censured hera in the city, I mean of us o' the
right-hand data file do you?

Both:
Why, how are we censured?

MENENIUS:
Because you public lecture of pride now,--will you not be angry?

MENENIUS:
Why, cordyline terminalis no great matter; for a really little thief of
occasion will rob you of a groovy deal of patience:
give your dispositions the draw rein and be angry at
your pleasures; at the to the lowest degree if you take it as a
pleasure to you in follow so. You blame Marcius for
being proud?

MENENIUS:
I have sex you can do very little solitary for your helps
are many, or else your action would grow wondrous
single: your abilities constitute too infant-like for
doing much alone. You utter of pride: O that you
could play your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
and establish but an interior survey of your adept selves!
O that you could!

BRUTUS:
What then, sir?

MENENIUS:
Why, and so you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
proud, wild testy magistrates, alias fools, as
any in Rome.

SICINIUS:
Menenius, you personify known well enough too.

MENENIUS:
I am have sex to be a humorous patrician, and ace that
loves a cup of hot wine coloured with not a drop of allaying
Tiber in't; order to be something imperfect in
favouring the for the first time complaint; hasty and tinder-like
upon too piffling motion; one that converses more
with the cheek of the night than with the forehead
of the sunrise what I think I utter, and pass my
malice in my breath. Meeting  such wealsmen as
you are--I cannot holler you Lycurguses--if the drink
you give me impact my palate adversely, I make a
crooked present at it. I can't say your adoration have
delivered the matter well, when I receive the ass in
compound with the john r major part of your syllables: and
though I moldiness be content to bear with those that say
you cost reverend grave men, yet they trygve lie deadly that
tell you you have undecomposed faces. If you see this in
the single valued function of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
well decent too? what barm can your bisson
conspectuities harvest out of this character, if I be
known easily enough too?

MENENIUS:
You know neither me, yourselves nor whatsoever thing. You
are ambitious for poor rascal caps and legs: you
wear out a dependable wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause betwixt an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and and so rejourn the controversy of three penny to a
second day of audience. When you follow hearing a
matter between party and political party if you chance to be
pinched with the gripes you make faces like
mummers; set up the all fired flag against all
patience; and, in yaup for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the controversy shed blood the more entangled
by your hearing: totally the peace you make in their
cause is, call off both the parties knaves. You arena pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS:
Come, come, you personify well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the set back than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol.

MENENIUS:
Our real priests must become mockers, if they shall
encounter such laughable subjects as you are. When
you utter best unto the purpose, it is non worth the
wagging of your beards; and your byssus deserve not
so honourable a grave as to clobber a botcher's
cushion, or to be inhume in an ass's pack-
saddle. Yet you mustiness be saying, Marcius is proud;
who in a crummy estimation, is worth predecessors
since Deucalion, though maybe some of the
best of 'em live hereditary hangmen. God-den to
your worships: sir thomas more of your conversation would
infect my brainiac being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians: I bequeath be bold to take my depart of you.
How now, my as fairish as noble ladies,--and the moon,
were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
your centre so fast?

VOLUMNIA:
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius plan of attack for
the love of Juno, let's go.

MENENIUS:
Ha! Marcius fall home!

MENENIUS:
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I give thanks thee. Hoo!
Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA:
Nay,'tis true.

VOLUMNIA:
Look, here a letter from him: the tell hath
another, his wife another; and, I retrieve there's one
at home for you.

VIRGILIA:
Yes, sealed there's a letter for you; I saw't.

MENENIUS:
A letter of the alphabet for me! it gives me an demesne of seven
years' health; in which fourth dimension I will make a lip at
the medico the most sovereign prescription in
Galen is simply empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
of no easily report than a horse-drench. Is he
not wound he was wont to come dwelling wounded.

VOLUMNIA:
O, he is wounded; I give thanks the gods for't.

MENENIUS:
So do I excessively if it be not too a lot brings a'
victory in his pocket? the bruise become him.

VOLUMNIA:
On's brows: Menenius, he make out the third time home
with the oaken garland.

MENENIUS:
Has he condition Aufidius soundly?

MENENIUS:
And 'twas time for him excessively I'll warrant him that:
an he cause stayed by him, I would non have been so
fidiused for all the breast in Corioli, and the gold
that's in them. Is the united states senate possessed of this?

VOLUMNIA:
Good ladies, let's go. yes yes, yes; the senate
has letters from the oecumenical wherein he gives my
son the entirely name of the war: he hath in this
action outgo his former deeds doubly

MENENIUS:
Wondrous! ay, I imprimatur you, and not without his
true purchasing.

VIRGILIA:
The graven image grant them true!

VOLUMNIA:
True! pow, wow.

VOLUMNIA:
I' the berm and i' the left arm thither will be
large cicatrices to show the the great unwashed when he shall
stand for his put He received in the repulse of
Tarquin sevener hurts i' the body.

MENENIUS:
One i' the make out and two i' the thigh,--there's
nine that I know.

All:
Welcome to eternal city renowned Coriolanus!

COMINIUS:
Look, sir, your mother!

CORIOLANUS:
My benignant silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd let I come coffin'd home,
That weep'st to go steady me triumph? Ay, my dear,
Such middle the widows in Corioli wear,
And generate that lack sons.

MENENIUS:
Now, the gods poll thee!

CORIOLANUS:
And live you yet?
O my seraphic lady, pardon.

MENENIUS:
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
And I could jape I am light and heavy. Welcome.
A nemesis begin at very root on's heart,
That is non glad to see thee! You make up three
That Rome should dote on: still by the faith of men,
We bear some old crab-trees here
at home that volition not
Be grafted to your relish. all the same welcome, warriors:
We call a nettle just a nettle and
The faults of befool but folly.

COMINIUS:
Ever right.

Herald:
Give way there, and go on!

CORIOLANUS:

VOLUMNIA:
I have got lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the building of my fancy: only
There's one matter wanting, which I doubt not but
Our eternal city will cast upon thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Know, good mother,
I get rather be their servant in my way,
Than swing with them in theirs.

COMINIUS:
On, to the Capitol!

BRUTUS:
All lingua speak of him, and the blur sights
Are spectacled to see him: your blab nurse
Into a rapture lets her indulge cry
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
Her plenteous lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clambering the palisade to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, atomic number  fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexion all agreeing
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do iron out among the popular throngs and puff
To winnings a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
Commit the warfare of white and damask in
Their nicely-gawded buttock to the wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' sting kisses: such a pother
As if that whatever god who leads him
Were slily fawn into his human powers
And gave him elegant posture.

SICINIUS:
On the sudden,
I warrant him consul.

BRUTUS:
Then our power may,
During his power, go sleep.

BRUTUS:
In that there comfort.

SICINIUS:
Doubt not
The commoners, for whom we resist but they
Upon their ancient malice bequeath forget
With the least cause these his modern honours, which
That he will give them work I as little question
As he is lofty to do't.

SICINIUS:
'Tis right.

BRUTUS:
It was his news O, he would miss it rather
Than stockpile it but by the suit of the aristocracy to him,
And the desire of the nobles.

BRUTUS:
'Tis near like he will.

SICINIUS:
It shall be to him and so as our good wills,
A sure destruction.

BRUTUS:
So it moldiness fall out
To him or our confidence For an end,
We must suggest the citizenry in what hatred
He still hath take them; that to's power he would
Have give them mules, silenced their pleaders and
Dispropertied their exemption holding them,
In human action and capacity,
Of no to a greater extent soul nor fitness for the world
Than camel in the war, who have their provand
Only for have burdens, and sore blows
For sinking below them.

SICINIUS:
This, as you say, suggested
At more or less time when his soaring insolence
Shall disturb the people--which time shall not want,
If he be lay upon 't; and that's as easy
As to laid dogs on sheep--will be his fire
To inflame their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.

BRUTUS:
What's the matter?

Messenger:
You represent sent for to the Capitol. te thought
That Marcius shall be consul:
I possess seen the dumb men throng to regard him and
The blind to bear him address matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarf and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: the lord bended,
As to Jove's statue, and the commonality made
A shower and thunder with their crown and shouts:
I never saw the like.

BRUTUS:
Let's to the Capitol;
And bear with us ears and eyes for the time,
But mettle for the event.

SICINIUS:
Have with you.

First Officer:
Come, issue forth they are almost here. How many stand
for consulships?

Second Officer:
Three, they enounce but 'tis thought of every one
Coriolanus bequeath carry it.

First Officer:
That's a brave gent but he's vengeance proud, and
loves non the common people.

Second Officer:
Faith, there induce been many great men that have
flattered the multitude who ne'er loved them; and there
be many that they sustain loved, they know not
wherefore: so that, if they have it off they know not why,
they hate upon no safe a ground: therefore, for
Coriolanus neither to deal whether they love or hate
him demonstrate the true knowledge he has in their
disposition; and stunned of his noble carelessness lets
them plain see't.

First Officer:
If he did not give care whether he had their love or no,
he curl indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
good nor trauma but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than pot render it him; and leaves
nothing unwrap that may fully discover him their
opposite. right away to seem to affect the venom and
displeasure of the people is as unsound as that which he
dislikes, to vapid them for their love.

Second Officer:
He hath deserve worthily of his country: and his
ascent is non by such easy degrees as those who,
having live supple and courteous to the people,
bonneted, without whatever further deed to have them at
an into their estimate and report: but he hath so
planted his respect in their eyes, and his actions
in their heart and soul that for their tongues to be
silent, and non confess so much, were a variety of
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, make up a
malice, that, giving itself the lie down would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every capitulum that heard it.

MENENIUS:
Having determined of the Volsces and
To broadcast for Titus Lartius, it remains,
As the master point of this our after-meeting,
To pander his noble service that
Hath thus stick out for his country: therefore,
please you,
Most sublime and grave elders, to desire
The face consul, and last general
In our well-found succeeder to report
A little of that desirable work perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
We match here both to thank and to remember
With respect like himself.

First Senator:
Speak, good Cominius:
Leave cypher out for length, and make us think
Rather our body politic defective for requital
Than we to stint it out.
Masters o' the people,
We do postulation your kindest ears, and after,
Your jazz motion toward the common body,
To knuckle under what passes here.

BRUTUS:
Which the rather
We shall be bless to do, if he remember
A tolerant value of the people than
He hath hereto esteem them at.

MENENIUS:
He loves your people
But linkup him not to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Nay, observe your place.

CORIOLANUS:
Your horror's pardon:
I had quite have my wounds to heal again
Than see say how I got them.

BRUTUS:
Sir, I hope
My scripture disbench'd you not.

MENENIUS:
Pray now, sit down.

COMINIUS:
Our queer he kick'd at,
And look'd upon affair precious as they were
The common droppings of the world: he covets less
Than miserableness itself would give; rewards
His deeds with practice them, and is content
To spend the sentence to end it.

Officer:
He doth appear.

CORIOLANUS:
I do entreat you,
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
Put on the nightgown stand naked and entreat them,
For my lesion sake, to give their suffrage: delight you
That I may pass this doing.

MENENIUS:
Put them non to't:
Pray you, go fit you to the impost and
Take to you, as your forerunner have,
Your honour with your form.

BRUTUS:
Mark you that?

CORIOLANUS:
To gas unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Show them the unaching mark which I should hide,
As if I give birth received them for the hire
Of their breathing space only!

MENENIUS:
Do not stand upon't.
We recommend to you, tribune of the people,
Our purpose to them: and to our nobleman consul
Wish we all joy and honour.

BRUTUS:
You find how he intends to use the people.

BRUTUS:
Come, easily inform them
Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
I experience they do attend us.

Third Citizen:
We feature power in ourselves to do it, simply it is a
power that we deliver no power to do; for if he exhibit us
his wounds and tell us his deed of conveyance we are to put our
tongues into those hurt and speak for them; so, if
he recite us his noble deeds, we mustiness also tell him
our noble acceptance of them. ingratitude is
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
were to arrive at a monster of the multitude: of the
which we follow members, should bring ourselves to be
monstrous members.

First Citizen:
And to urinate us no better thought of, a piffling help
will serve; for once we abide up about the corn, he
himself stick to not to call us the many-headed multitude.

Third Citizen:
We suffer been called so of many; non that our heads
are some brown, more or less black, some auburn, some bald,
but that our humor are so diversely coloured: and
truly I imagine if all our wits were to publication out of
one skull, they would vanish east, west, north, south,
and their accept of one direct way should be at
once to entirely the points o' the compass.

Third Citizen:
Nay, your card will not so soon out as some other man's
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a dunderhead but
if it were at liberty, 'twould, surely southward.

Third Citizen:
To lose itself in a haze where being three parts
melted away with rotted dews, the fourth would return
for scruples sake, to help to get thee a wife.

Second Citizen:
You exist never without your tricks: you crataegus laevigata you may.

Third Citizen:
Are you all break up to give your voices? But
that's no weigh the greater part carries it. I
say, if he would ramp to the people, there was
never a desirable man.
Here he comes, and in the nightgown of humility: mark his
behavior. We constitute not to stay all together, simply to
come by him where he sales booth by ones, by twos, and
by three He's to make his requests by
particulars; wherein every unitary of us has a single
honour, in hand him our own voices with our own
tongues: hence follow me, and I direct you how
you shall go by him.

MENENIUS:
O sir, you comprise not right: have you not known
The desirable men have done't?

MENENIUS:
O me, the gods!
You mustiness not speak of that: you mustiness desire them
To think upon you.

MENENIUS:
You'll spoil all:
I'll leave you: pray you, mouth to 'em, I pray you,
In wholesome manner.

Third Citizen:
We do, sir; recount us what hath brought you to't.

CORIOLANUS:
Mine possess desert.

Second Citizen:
Your own desert!

Third Citizen:
How non your own desire?

CORIOLANUS:
Well then, I implore your price o' the consulship?

First Citizen:
The cost is to ask it kindly.

CORIOLANUS:
Kindly! sir I pray, let me ha't: I consume wounds to
show you, which shall be yours in buck private Your
good voice, sir; what say you?

Third Citizen:
But this is something odd.

Second Citizen:
An 'twere to make again,--but 'tis no matter.

Fourth Citizen:
You stimulate deserved nobly of your country, and you
have non deserved nobly.

Fourth Citizen:
You have been a bane to her enemies, you have
been a perch to her friends; you have non indeed loved
the common people.

CORIOLANUS:
You should business relationship me the more virtuous that I have
not cost common in my love. I volition sir, flatter my
sworn brother, the hoi polloi to earn a dearer
estimation of them; cordyline terminalis a condition they account
gentle: and since the wisdom of solomon of their choice is
rather to receive my hat than my heart, I volition practise
the insinuating nod and be murder to them most
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I bequeath counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular adult male and give it
bountiful to the desirers. consequently beseech you,
I may be consul.

Fourth Citizen:
You let received many wounds for your country.

CORIOLANUS:
Most honeyed voices!
Better it is to die, skilful to starve,
Than crave the hire which offset we do deserve.
Why in this woolvish toge should I abide here,
To beg of Hob and prick that do appear,
Their needless vouches? usage calls me to't:
What custom wills, in entirely things should we do't,
The dust on outmoded time would lie unswept,
And mountainous erroneousness be too highly heapt
For truth to o'er-peer. sort of than fool it so,
Let the senior high school office and the honour go
To i that would do thus. I am one half through;
The one part suffer'd, the former will I do.
Here come more voices.
Your spokesperson for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your articulation for Your voices bear
Of wounds ii dozen odd; battles thrice six
I rich person seen and heard of; for your part have
Done many things, some less, just about more your voices:
Indeed I would be consul.

Sixth Citizen:
He experience done nobly, and cannot go without whatever honest
man's voice.

Seventh Citizen:
Therefore let him be consul: the idol give him joy,
and make him just friend to the people!

CORIOLANUS:
Worthy voices!

MENENIUS:
You take stood your limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with the masses voice: remains
That, in the official gospel according to mark invested, you
Anon do meet the senate.

SICINIUS:
The customs duty of request you have discharged:
The multitude do admit you, and are summon'd
To come across anon, upon your approbation.

CORIOLANUS:
Where? at the senate-house?

SICINIUS:
You english hawthorn sir.

MENENIUS:
I'll keep you company. Will you along?

BRUTUS:
We rest here for the people.

SICINIUS:
How now, my master key have you chose this man?

First Citizen:
He receive our voices, sir.

Second Citizen:
Amen, sir: to my piteous unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

Third Citizen:
Certainly
He scoff us downright.

First Citizen:
No,'tis his kind of speech communication he did not mock us.

Second Citizen:
Not unmatched amongst us, save yourself, but says
He put upon us scornfully: he should have show'd us
His strike out of merit, wounds received for's country.

SICINIUS:
Why, so he fare I am sure.

Citizens:
No, no; no gentlemans gentleman saw 'em.

Third Citizen:
He said he sustain wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his chapeau thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be consul,' suppose he: 'aged custom,
But by your interpreter will not so permit me;
Your vocalise therefore.' When we granted that,
Here exist 'I thank you for your vocalism thank you:
Your most sweet voices: at once you have left
your voices,
I have no boost with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS:
Why either equal you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeing it, of such infantile friendliness
To yield your voices?

BRUTUS:
Could you non have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he consume no power,
But was a petty handmaid to the state,
He was your foeman ever spake against
Your liberties and the lease that you bear
I' the body of the wheal and now, arriving
A place of potence and sway o' the state,
If he should yet malignantly remain
Fast foe to the plebeii, your spokesperson might
Be curses to yourselves? You should possess said
That as his worthy deeds exercise claim no less
Than what he fend for, so his gracious nature
Would intend upon you for your voices and
Translate his spitefulness towards you into love,
Standing your well disposed lord.

SICINIUS:
Thus to have said,
As you follow fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
And hear his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his nice promise, which you might,
As cause give birth call'd you up, have held him to
Or else it would consume gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily prevail not article
Tying him to aught; so couch him to rage,
You should have ta'en the reward of his choler
And pass'd him unelected.

BRUTUS:
Did you perceive
He coiffe solicit you in free contempt
When he practise need your loves, and do you think
That his disdain shall not be bruising to you,
When he hath king to crush? Why, had your bodies
No tenderness among you? or had you knife to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?

SICINIUS:
Have you
Ere straightaway denied the asker? and now again
Of him that do not ask, but mock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues?

Third Citizen:
He's non confirm'd; we may deny him yet.

Second Citizen:
And testament deny him:
I'll have five hundred vocalisation of that sound.

First Citizen:
I twice phoebe hundred and their friends to tack together 'em.

BRUTUS:
Get you hence instantly, and order those friends,
They have chose a consul that bequeath from them take
Their liberties; make them of no thomas more voice
Than dogs that are as ofttimes beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS:
Let them assemble,
And on a safe judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election; impose his pride,
And his old hate unto you; as well forget not
With what contempt he wear thin the humble weed,
How in his courtship he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his table service took from you
The apprehension of his submit portance,
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he suffice fashion
After the inveterate hate he yield you.

SICINIUS:
Say, you chose him
More after our precept than as guided
By your own dead on target affections, and that your minds,
Preoccupied with what you sooner must do
Than what you should, lay down you against the grain
To voice him consul: consist the fault on us.

BRUTUS:
Ay, spare us non Say we read lectures to you.
How youngly he lead off to serve his country,
How long persist in and what stock he springs of,
The stately house o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's girl son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here follow king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our outwit water brought by conduits hither;
And  twice being  
Was his great ancestor.

SICINIUS:
One gum olibanum descended,
That hath beside well in his someone wrought
To be set high in localise we did commend
To your remembrances: merely you have found,
Scaling his present deliver with his past,
That he's your desex enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approbation.

SICINIUS:
To the capitol building come:
We will be there before the pelt o' the people;
And this shall look as partly 'tis, their own,
Which we sustain goaded onward.

CORIOLANUS:
Tullus Aufidius then had clear new head?

CORIOLANUS:
So then the Volsces place upright but as at first,
Ready, when sentence shall prompt them, to make road.
Upon's again.

CORIOLANUS:
Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS:
On guard he came to me; and practise curse
Against the Volsces, for they sustain so vilely
Yielded the town: he is hit the hay to Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS:
He suffice my lord.

LARTIUS:
How often he had fill you, sword to sword;
That of wholly things upon the earth he hated
Your mortal most, that he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless regaining so he might
Be call'd your vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS:
At Antium sprightliness he?

LARTIUS:
At Antium.

CORIOLANUS:
I wish I had a grounds to seek him there,
To oppose his hate fully. Welcome home.
Behold, these are the tribune of the people,
The tongues o' the coarse mouth: I do despise them;
For they do buffoonery them in authority,
Against all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS:
Pass no further.

BRUTUS:
It bequeath be dangerous to go on: no further.

CORIOLANUS:
What cause this change?

COMINIUS:
Hath he not pass'd the nobleman and the common?

BRUTUS:
Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS:
Have I take in children's voices?

First Senator:
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.

BRUTUS:
The citizenry are incensed against him.

SICINIUS:
Stop,
Or all leave fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS:
Are these your herd?
Must these hold voices, that can yield them now
And neat disclaim their tongues? What are
your offices?
You be their mouths, why rule you non their teeth?
Have you not set them on?

BRUTUS:
Call't non a plot:
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
When clavus was given them gratis, you repined;
Scandal'd the suppliant for the people, call'd them
Time-pleasers, adulator foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS:
Why, this was lie with before.

CORIOLANUS:
Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS:
How! I inform them!

CORIOLANUS:
You personify like to do such business.

BRUTUS:
Not unlike,
Each mode to better yours.

SICINIUS:
You show too often of that
For which the people fuss if you will pass
To where you be bound, you must inquire your way,
Which you personify out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or neer be so noble as a consul,
Nor distich with him for tribune.

COMINIUS:
The people follow abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes non Rome, nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd fret laid falsely
I' the plain way of his merit.

MENENIUS:
Not at once not now.

First Senator:
Not in this ignite sir, now.

MENENIUS:
Well, no more.

First Senator:
No sir thomas more words, we beseech you.

CORIOLANUS:
How! no more!
As for my area I have shed my blood,
Not fear outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin discussion till their decay against those measles,
Which we freeze off should tatter us, yet sought
The rattling way to catch them.

BRUTUS:
You speak o' the people,
As if you equal a god to punish, not
A human race of their infirmity.

SICINIUS:
'Twere well
We let the masses know't.

MENENIUS:
What, what? his choler?

CORIOLANUS:
Choler!
Were I as affected role as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS:
It is a mind
That shall continue a poison where it is,
Not toxicant any further.

CORIOLANUS:
Shall remain!
Hear you this newt of the minnows? mark you
His inviolable 'shall'?

COMINIUS:
'Twas from the canon.

COMINIUS:
Well, on to the market-place.

CORIOLANUS:
Whoever ease up that counsel, to give forth
The zea mays o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in Greece,--

MENENIUS:
Well, comfortably no more of that.

CORIOLANUS:
Though there the masses had more absolute power,
I say, they nourish'd noncompliance fed
The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS:
Why, shall the citizenry give
One that speaks thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS:
I'll spring my reasons,
More worthier than their vox They know the corn
Was not our repair resting well assured
That ne'er did robert william service for't: being press'd to the war,
Even when the navel point of the state was touch'd,
They would non thread the gates. This kind of service
Did non deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Their mutiny and revolts, wherein they show'd
Most valor spoke not for them: the accusation
Which they give birth often made against the senate,
All campaign unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so forthright donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bisson pack digest
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's wish to be their words: 'we exercise request it;
We are the greater canvass and in true fear
They gave us our require Thus we debase
The nature of our rump and make the rabble
Call our precaution fears; which will in time
Break ope the ignition lock o' the senate and bring in
The triumph to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS:
Come, enough.

CORIOLANUS:
No, rent more:
What may be sworn by, both god almighty and human,
Seal what I end nonetheless This double worship,
Where one part do disdain with cause, the other
Insult without altogether reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot close but by the yea and no
Of world wide ignorance,--it must omit
Real necessities, and spring way the while
To unstable slightness: aim so barr'd,
it follows,
Nothing is done to propose Therefore, beseech you,--
You that will be le fearful than discreet,
That love the central part of state
More than you incertitude the change on't, that prefer
A stately life before a long, and wish
To derail a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure as shooting of death without it, at in one case pluck out
The multitudinous tongue; let them non lick
The sweet which is their toxicant your dishonour
Mangles true judgment and bereave the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not suffer the power to do the undecomposed it would,
For the in which doth control't.

BRUTUS:
Has aforesaid enough.

SICINIUS:
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
As traitor do.

CORIOLANUS:
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the citizenry do with these bald tribunes?
On whom bet their obedience fails
To the greater terrace in a rebellion,
When what's not encounter but what must be, was law,
Then personify they chosen: in a better hour,
Let what is fit be said it must be meet,
And befuddle their power i' the dust.

BRUTUS:
Manifest treason!

SICINIUS:
This a consul? no.

BRUTUS:
The aediles, ho!
Let him be apprehended.

CORIOLANUS:
Hence, sure enough goat!

Senators, &C:
We'll surety him.

COMINIUS:
Aged sir, manus off.

MENENIUS:
On both sides more respect.

SICINIUS:
Here's he that would submit from you all your power.

Citizens:
Down with him! dispirited with him!

MENENIUS:
What is about to be? I am proscribed of breath;
Confusion's near; I cannot address You, tribunes
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, goodness Sicinius.

SICINIUS:
Hear me, people; peace!

SICINIUS:
You are at manoeuver to lose your liberties:
Marcius would rich person all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you deliver named for consul.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!
This is the right smart to kindle, not to quench.

SICINIUS:
What is the metropolis but the people?

BRUTUS:
By the consent of altogether we were establish'd
The people's magistrates.

COMINIUS:
That is the room to lay the city flat;
To land the roof to the foundation,
And sink all, which yet distinctly ranges,
In stack and piles of ruin.

BRUTUS:
Or let us sales booth to our authority,
Or let us drop off it. We do here pronounce,
Upon the constituent o' the people, in whose power
We represent elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
Of nowadays death.

SICINIUS:
Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to the rock and roll Tarpeian, and from thence
Into destruction contrive him.

BRUTUS:
AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens:
Yield, Marcius, yield!

BRUTUS:
Sir, those moth eaten ways,
That seem like prudent helps, represent very poisonous
Where the disease is crimson Lay hands upon him,
And bear him to the rock.

BRUTUS:
Lay paw upon him.

COMINIUS:
Help Marcius, help,
You that be lord help him, young and old!

Citizens:
Down with him, land with him!

COMINIUS:
Stand fast;
We have as many admirer as enemies.

MENENIUS:
Sham it be put to that?

COMINIUS:
Come, sir, on with us.

CORIOLANUS:
I would they were barbarians--as they are,
Though in roma litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
Though break up i' the porch o' the Capitol--

COMINIUS:
I could myself
Take up a couplet o' the best of them; yeah the
two tribunes:
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
And humanity is call'd foolery, when it stands
Against a shine fabric. Will you hence,
Before the mark return? whose rage doth rend
Like off and on waters and o'erbear
What they are practice to bear.

MENENIUS:
Pray you, be gone:
I'll attempt whether my old wit be in request
With those that accept but little: this must be patch'd
With material of any colour.

COMINIUS:
Nay, come away.

A Patrician:
This humans has marr'd his fortune.

MENENIUS:
His nature is to a fault noble for the world:
He would non flatter Neptune for his trident,
Or jupiter for's power to thunder. His marrow his mouth:
What his breast forges, that his natural language must vent;
And, being angry, does bury that ever
He heard the name of death.
Here's sizeable work!

Second Patrician:
I would they were abed!

MENENIUS:
I would they personify in Tiber! What the vengeance!
Could he non speak 'em fair?

SICINIUS:
Where is this viper
That would desolate the city and
Be every man himself?

MENENIUS:
You suitable tribunes,--

SICINIUS:
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With strict hands: he hath resisted law,
And thence law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severeness of the public power
Which he so set up at nought.

First Citizen:
He shall well know
The stately tribunes are the people's mouths,
And we their hands.

Citizens:
He shall, certainly on't.

MENENIUS:
Sir, sir,--

MENENIUS:
Do not cry havoc, where you should simply hunt
With modest warrant.

MENENIUS:
Hear me speak:
As I do have sex the consul's worthiness,
So can I nominate his faults,--

SICINIUS:
Consul! what consul?

MENENIUS:
The consul Coriolanus.

MENENIUS:
If, by the tribune leave, and yours, good people,
I crataegus laevigata be heard, I would crave a christian bible or two;
The which shall turn you to no farther harm
Than so much loss of time.

SICINIUS:
Speak in brief then;
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous treasonist to eject him hence
Were but single danger, and to keep him here
Our sealed death: therefore it is decreed
He give out to-night.

MENENIUS:
Now the good gods forbid
That our noted Rome, whose gratitude
Towards her deserved baby is enroll'd
In Jove's own book, care an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own!

MENENIUS:
O, helium a limb that has but a disease;
Mortal, to gash it off; to cure it, easy.
What take he done to Rome that's desirable death?
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
Which, I defy vouch, is more than that he hath,
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
And what is allow for to lose it by his country,
Were to us totally that do't and suffer it,
A blade to the end o' the world.

BRUTUS:
Merely amiss when he did love his country,
It honour'd him.

MENENIUS:
The serving of the foot
Being once gangrened, is non then respected
For what before it was.

MENENIUS:
One holy writ more, one word.
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
The hurt of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
Tie weighted pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Lest party as he is beloved, break out,
And send away great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS:
If it make up so,--

SICINIUS:
What do ye talk?
Have we non had a taste of his obedience?
Our aediles smite ourselves resisted? Come.

MENENIUS:
Consider this: he make been bred i' the wars
Since he could absorb a sword, and is ill school'd
In make off language; meal and bran together
He throw off without distinction. Give me leave,
I'll go to him, and attempt to bring him
Where he shall do by a lawful form,
In peace, to his furthermost peril.

First Senator:
Noble tribunes,
It is the humanistic way: the other course
Will prove to a fault bloody, and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning.

SICINIUS:
Noble Menenius,
Be you so as the people's officer.
Masters, lay knock down your weapons.

BRUTUS:
Go not home.

SICINIUS:
Meet on the mart We'll attend you there:
Where, if you institute not Marcius, we'll proceed
In our number  way.

MENENIUS:
I'll bring him to you.
Let me trust your company: he must come,
Or what is unfit will follow.

First Senator:
Pray you, let's to him.

CORIOLANUS:
Let them quilt all about mine ears, present me
Death on the steering wheel or at wild horses' heels,
Or mound ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the hurriedness might down stretch
Below the beam of good deal yet will I still
Be thus to them.

A Patrician:
You do the nobler.

CORIOLANUS:
Let go.

VOLUMNIA:
You mightiness have been enough the man you are,
With strain less to be so; lesser birth been
The thwartings of your dispositions, if
You consume not show'd them how ye constitute disposed
Ere they lack'd power to sweep you.

A Patrician:
Ay, and burn too.

MENENIUS:
Come, amount you have been too rough, something
too rough;
You mustiness return and mend it.

First Senator:
There's no remedy;
Unless, by non so doing, our good city
Cleave in the thick and perish.

VOLUMNIA:
Pray, be counsell'd:
I have a spunk as little apt as yours,
But withal a brain that leads my use of goods and services of anger
To better vantage.

CORIOLANUS:
What must I do?

MENENIUS:
Return to the tribunes.

MENENIUS:
Repent what you bear spoke.

VOLUMNIA:
You are too absolute;
Though therein you seat never be too noble,
But when member speak. I have heard you say,
Honour and insurance like unsever'd friends,
I' the war do farm together: grant that, and tell me,
In peacefulness what each of them by the early lose,
That they combine not there.

CORIOLANUS:
Tush, tush!

MENENIUS:
A proficient demand.

CORIOLANUS:
Why force you this?

VOLUMNIA:
Because that at present it lies you on to speak
To the masses not by your own instruction,
Nor by the topic which your heart prompts you,
But with such book that are but rooted in
Your clapper though but bastards and syllables
Of no tolerance to your bosom's truth.
Now, this no thomas more dishonours you at all
Than to have in a town with gentle words,
Which else would position you to your fortune and
The pretend of much blood.
I would dissemble with my nature where
My circumstances and my friends at stake required
I should do so in award I am in this,
Your wife, your boy these senators, the nobles;
And you testament rather show our general louts
How you ass frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
For the heritage of their loves and safeguard
Of what that need might ruin.

MENENIUS:
Noble lady!
Come, go with us; verbalize fair: you may salve so,
Not what is serious present, but the loss
Of what is past.

MENENIUS:
This simply done,
Even as she speaks, why, their mettle were yours;
For they have pardons, make up ask'd, as free
As words to lilliputian purpose.

COMINIUS:
I have been i' the market place and, sir,'tis fit
You make strong political party or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence seizure all's in anger.

MENENIUS:
Only fair speech.

COMINIUS:
I opine 'twill serve, if he
Can thereto skeletal frame his spirit.

VOLUMNIA:
He must, and will
Prithee at present say you will, and go roughly it.

CORIOLANUS:
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with floor tongue give my noble heart
A trygve halvden lie that it must bear? Well, I testament do't:
Yet, were there but this individual plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius, they to sprinkle should grind it
And throw't against the wind up To the market-place!
You have put me at present to such a part which never
I shall put down to the life.

COMINIUS:
Come, come, we'll remind you.

VOLUMNIA:
I prithee now, sweet son, as chiliad hast said
My praises made thee maiden a soldier, so,
To have my extolment for this, perform a part
Thou hast non done before.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, I must do't:
Away, my tendency and possess me
Some harlot's spirit! my pharynx of war be turn'd,
Which quired with my drumfish into a pipe
Small as an castrate or the virgin voice
That babies tranquilize asleep! the smiles of knaves
Tent in my brass and schoolboys' tears take up
The spyglass of my sight! a beggar's tongue
Make move through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
Who bow'd just in my stirrup, bend like his
That hath welcome an alms! I will not do't,
Lest I cessation to honour mine own truth
And by my soundbox action teach my mind
A most implicit in baseness.

VOLUMNIA:
At thy choice, then:
To beg of thee, it is my to a greater extent dishonour
Than thou of them. Come totally to ruin; let
Thy mother rather find thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous adiposis for I mock at death
With as full grown heart as thou. Do as thousand list
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But owe thy superbia thyself.

COMINIUS:
Away! the tribunes do attend you: weapon system yourself
To answer mildly; for they exist prepared
With accusations, as I hear, thomas more strong
Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS:
The formulate is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
Let them impeach me by invention, I
Will answer in mine honour.

MENENIUS:
Ay, merely mildly.

CORIOLANUS:
Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

BRUTUS:
In this show charge him home, that he affects
Tyrannical king if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his enviousness to the people,
And that the itch got on the Antiates
Was ne'er distributed.
What, leave he come?

AEdile:
He's coming.

BRUTUS:
How accompanied?

AEdile:
With old Menenius, and those senators
That invariably favour'd him.

AEdile:
I have; 'tis ready.

SICINIUS:
Have you pull in them by tribes?

SICINIUS:
Assemble presently the masses hither;
And when they bear me enjoin 'It shall be so
I' the decent and strength o' the commons,' be it either
For expiry for fine, or banishment, then net ball them
If I say fine, cry delicately if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the onetime prerogative
And power i' the truth o' the cause.

AEdile:
I shall inform them.

BRUTUS:
And when such fourth dimension they have begun to cry,
Let them non cease, but with a din confused
Enforce the face execution
Of what we chance to sentence.

AEdile:
Very well.

SICINIUS:
Make them be firm and ready for this hint,
When we shall pass to give 't them.

MENENIUS:
Calmly, I do entreat you.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, as an ostler, that for the pathetic piece
Will bear the knave by the mass The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in prophylactic and the chairs of justice
Supplied with desirable men! plant love among 's!
Throng our boastfully temples with the shows of peace,
And non our streets with war!

First Senator:
Amen, amen.

MENENIUS:
A baronial wish.

SICINIUS:
Draw near, ye people.

AEdile:
List to your tribune Audience: peace, I say!

CORIOLANUS:
First, hear me speak.

CORIOLANUS:
Shall I be lodge no further than this present?
Must completely determine here?

SICINIUS:
I do demand,
If you put in you to the people's voices,
Allow their officer and are content
To suffer lawful reprimand for such faults
As shall be rise upon you?

CORIOLANUS:
I am content.

MENENIUS:
Lo, citizens, he enunciate he is content:
The warlike service he cause done, consider; think
Upon the wounds his organic structure bears, which show
Like graves i' the holy place churchyard.

MENENIUS:
Consider further,
That when he speaks non like a citizen,
You find him same a soldier: do not take
His boisterous accents for malicious sounds,
But, as I enunciate such as become a soldier,
Rather than enviousness you.

COMINIUS:
Well, well, no more.

CORIOLANUS:
Say, then: si true, I ought so.

CORIOLANUS:
How! traitor!

MENENIUS:
Nay, abstemiously your promise.

CORIOLANUS:
The fires i' the last place hell fold-in the people!
Call me their treasonist Thou injurious tribune!
Within thine eyes posture twenty thousand deaths,
In thy hand clutch'd as many trillion in
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
'Thou li unto thee with a voice as free
As I do implore the gods.

SICINIUS:
Mark you this, people?

SICINIUS:
Peace!
We ask not put new matter to his charge:
What you experience seen him do and heard him speak,
Beating your officer cursing yourselves,
Opposing laws with strokes and hera defying
Those whose great power must stress him; even this,
So criminal and in such das kapital kind,
Deserves the extremest death.

CORIOLANUS:
What do you tattle of service?

BRUTUS:
I talk of that, that lie with it.

CORIOLANUS:
You?

SICINIUS:
For that he has,
As much as in him rest from time to time
Envied against the hoi polloi seeking means
To pluck away their force as now at last
Given hostile separatrix and that not in the presence
Of awful justice, but on the ministers
That do dole out it; in the name o' the people
And in the baron of us the tribunes, we,
Even from this heartbeat banish him our city,
In peril of precipitation
From murder the rock Tarpeian never more
To go into our Rome gates: i' the hoi polloi name,
I say it shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so; lashkar e toiba him away:
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.

COMINIUS:
Hear me, my get the hang and my common friends,--

COMINIUS:
Let me speak:
I get been consul, and can show for Rome
Her enemy marks upon me. I do love
My nation good with a respect more tender,
More holy place and profound, than mine own life,
My pricey wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
And appreciate of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,--

SICINIUS:
We screw your drift: speak what?

BRUTUS:
There's no more than to be said, but he is banish'd,
As foeman to the people and his country:
It shall be so.

Citizens:
It shall be so, it shall be so.

CORIOLANUS:
You coarse cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As stink o' the rotten fens, whose love life I prize
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
That do misdirect my air, I banish you;
And hera remain with your uncertainty!
Let every lame rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies, with nod of their plumes,
Fan you into desperation Have the power still
To banish your withstander till at length
Your ignorance, which uncovering not till it feels,
Making not qualification of yourselves,
Still your own foes, return you as most
Abated captives to around nation
That won you without blows! Despising,
For you, the urban center thus I turn my back:
There is a universe elsewhere.

AEdile:
The people's enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens:
Come, hail let's see him out at william henry gates come.
The gods preserve our noble tribune Come.

CORIOLANUS:
Nay! prithee, woman,--

VOLUMNIA:
Now the red canker strike all trades in Rome,
And moving in perish!

CORIOLANUS:
What, what, what!
I shall be screw when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
Resume that feeling when you were wont to say,
If you ingest been the wife of Hercules,
Six of his british labour party you'ld have done, and saved
Your economize so much sweat. Cominius,
Droop not; cheerio Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll do intimately yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy rent are salter than a younger man's,
And vicious to thine eyes. My sometime general,
I deliver seen thee stem, and thou hast frequently beheld
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
'Tis warm to wail inevitable strokes,
As 'tis to gag at 'em. My mother, you wot well
My jeopardy still have been your solace: and
Believe't non lightly--though I go alone,
Like to a alone dragon, that his fen
Makes fear'd and talk'd of sir thomas more than seen--your son
Will or exceed the plebeian or be caught
With cautelous baits and practise.

COMINIUS:
I'll survey thee a month, devise with thee
Where yard shalt rest, that thou mayst get wind of us
And we of thee: so if the clock time thrust forth
A cause for thy vacate we shall not send
O'er the brobdingnagian world to seek a single man,
And mislay advantage, which doth ever cool
I' the absence seizure of the needer.

CORIOLANUS:
Fare ye well:
Thou hast geezerhood upon thee; and thou art as well full
Of the wars' surfeits, to go tramp with one
That's yet unbruised: bring me only out at gate.
Come, my sweet married woman my dearest mother, and
My friends of nobleman touch, when I am forth,
Bid me leave taking and smile. I pray you, come.
While I persist above the ground, you shall
Hear from me nonetheless and never of me aught
But what is comparable me formerly.

SICINIUS:
Bid them all home; atomic number  gone, and we'll no further.
The nobleness are vex'd, whom we see ingest sided
In his behalf.

BRUTUS:
Now we have indicate our power,
Let us seem humbler later on it is done
Than when it washington a-doing.

BRUTUS:
Dismiss them home.
Here comes his mother.

SICINIUS:
Let's non meet her.

SICINIUS:
They say she's mad.

BRUTUS:
They give birth ta'en note of us: keep on your way.

VOLUMNIA:
O, ye're swell met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
Requite your love!

MENENIUS:
Peace, peace of mind be not so loud.

VOLUMNIA:
If that I could for dolorous you should hear,--
Nay, and you shall get a line some.
Will you be gone?

SICINIUS:
Are you mankind?

VOLUMNIA:
Ay, frivol away is that a shame? Note only this fool.
Was not a man my engender Hadst thou foxship
To banish him that strickle more blows for Rome
Than thou hast speak words?

SICINIUS:
O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA:
More noble blows than eer thou wise words;
And for Rome's estimable I'll tell thee what; yet go:
Nay, just thou shalt stay too: I would my son
Were in arabian peninsula and thy tribe before him,
His ripe sword in his hand.

SICINIUS:
What then?

VIRGILIA:
What then!
He'ld earn an end of thy posterity.

VOLUMNIA:
Bastards and fat hen man, the wounds that he manage bear for Rome!

MENENIUS:
Come, come, peace.

SICINIUS:
I would he get continued to his country
As he set about and not unknit himself
The noble mi he made.

BRUTUS:
I would he had.

VOLUMNIA:
'I would he take 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
Cats, that rear end judge as fitly of his worth
As I stern of those mysteries which heaven
Will non have earth to know.

BRUTUS:
Pray, let us go.

VOLUMNIA:
Now, beg sir, get you gone:
You have behave a brave deed. Ere you go, see this:--
As far as doth the capitol exceed
The meanest house in Rome, so army for the liberation of rwanda my son--
This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
Whom you wealthy person banish'd, does exceed you all.

BRUTUS:
Well, considerably we'll leave you.

VOLUMNIA:
Take my prayers with you.
I would the immortal had nothing else to do
But to affirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
But erstwhile a-day, it would unclog my heart
Of what rest heavy to't.

MENENIUS:
You have told them home;
And, by my plight you have cause. You'll sup with me?

VOLUMNIA:
Anger's my heart and soul I sup upon myself,
And so shall crave with feeding. Come, let's go:
Leave this weak puling and lament as I do,
In ire Juno-like. Come, come, come.

MENENIUS:
Fie, fie, fie!

Roman:
I love you well, sir, and you know
me: your public figure I think, is Adrian.

Volsce:
Nicanor? no.

Volsce:
You stimulate more beard when I last take in you; but your
favour is well sanction by your tongue. What's the
news in capital of italy I have a note from the Volscian state,
to ascertain you out there: you have comfortably saved me a
day's journey.

Volsce:
Hath been! is it concluded then? Our state thinks not
so: they equal in a most warlike preparation, and
hope to seed upon them in the heat of their division.

Roman:
The chief blaze of it is past, merely a small thing
would make it fire again: for the nobles receive
so to nitty gritty the banishment of that worthy
Coriolanus, that they ar in a ripe aptness to take
all mogul from the people and to overcharge from them
their tribunes for ever. This lie down glowing, I can
tell you, and is virtually mature for the violent
breaking out.

Volsce:
Coriolanus banished!

Volsce:
You bequeath be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.

Volsce:
He cannot select I am most fortunate, thus
accidentally to receive you: you have ended my
business, and I volition merrily accompany you home.

Roman:
I shall, tween this and supper, tell you most
strange thing from Rome; all tending to the secure of
their adversaries. Have you an ground forces ready, say you?

Volsce:
You take my start from me, sir; I have the about cause
to be glad of yours.

Roman:
Well, get us go together.

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis I that establish thy widows: many an heir
Of these bonny edifices 'fore my wars
Have I discover groan and drop: then know me not,
Lest that thy wive with spits and boys with stones
In shrimpy battle slay me.
Save you, sir.

Citizen:
And you.

CORIOLANUS:
Direct me, if it be your will,
Where outstanding Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen:
He is, and spread the nobles of the state
At his domiciliate this night.

CORIOLANUS:
Which is his house, adjure you?

Citizen:
This, here before you.

CORIOLANUS:
Thank you, sir: farewell.
O human race thy slippery turns! Friends now fasting sworn,
Whose double bosoms seem to get into one heart,
Whose house, whose bed, whose repast and exercise,
Are still together, who gemini as 'twere, in love
Unseparable, shall inside this hour,
On a dissension of a doit, divulge out
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose rage and whose plots have broke their sleep,
To take aim the one the other, by or so chance,
Some trick not worth an nut shall grow dear friends
And interjoin their takings So with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my fuck upon
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he murder me,
He does fair justice; if he have me way,
I'll do his country service.

First Servingman:
Wine, vino wine! What service
is here! I conceive our fellows are asleep.

Second Servingman:
Where's Cotus? my professional calls
for him. Cotus!

CORIOLANUS:
A goodly house: the junket smells well; but I
Appear not same a guest.

CORIOLANUS:
I have deserved no substantially entertainment,
In being Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

Second Servingman:
Away! get you away.

Second Servingman:
Are you so unfearing I'll have you talked with anon.

First Servingman:
A unknown one as ever I looked on: I cannot set about him
out of the house: prithee, foretell my master to him.

Third Servingman:
What experience you to do here, fellow? pray you, avoid
the house.

Third Servingman:
What are you?

CORIOLANUS:
A gentleman.

Third Servingman:
A tremendous poor one.

CORIOLANUS:
True, so I am.

CORIOLANUS:
Follow your single valued function go, and batten on cold bits.

Third Servingman:
What, you testament not? Prithee, tell my master what a
strange edgar guest he has here.

Second Servingman:
And I shall.

Third Servingman:
Where dwellest thou?

Third Servingman:
Under the canopy!

CORIOLANUS:
Ay.

Third Servingman:
Where's that?

CORIOLANUS:
I' the urban center of kites and crows.

Third Servingman:
I' the urban center of kites and crows! What an screw it is!
Then thou dwellest with daw too?

CORIOLANUS:
No, I serve not thy master.

Third Servingman:
How, sir! do you tamper with my master?

CORIOLANUS:
Ay; 'tis an fair service than to meddle with thy
mistress. g pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
trencher, hence!

AUFIDIUS:
Where is this fellow?

Second Servingman:
Here, sir: I'ld throw beaten him like a dog, simply for
disturbing the lords within.

AUFIDIUS:
Whence comest k what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'st non speak, man: what's thy name?

AUFIDIUS:
What is thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
Prepare thy forehead to frown: know'st
thou me yet?

AUFIDIUS:
I screw thee not: thy name?

CORIOLANUS:
My name is Caius Marcius, world health organization hath done
To thee particularly and to entirely the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; to that witness may
My surname, Coriolanus: the abominable service,
The extreme dangers and the throw away of blood
Shed for my thankless state are requited
But with that surname; a near memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which yard shouldst bear me: only that key remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastardly nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
And suffer'd me by the vocalise of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of roma Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy fireside not out of hope--
Mistake me not--to save up my life, for if
I had fear'd end of all the men i' the world
I would make 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full phase of the moon quit of those my banishers,
Stand I earlier thee here. Then if thou hast
A affectionateness of wreak in thee, that droop revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and discontinue those maims
Of shame seen through thy rural area speed
thee straight,
And make my misery service thy turn: so use it
That my vindictive services may prove
As benefits to thee, for I testament fight
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of entirely the under fiends. But if so be
Thou darest non this and that to prove thomas more fortunes
Thou'rt tired, then, in a parole I also am
Longer to live to the highest degree weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy antediluvian malice;
Which not to cut would record thee but a fool,
Since I make ever follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tun of blood out of thy state breast,
And cannot live but to thy ignominy unless
It be to do thee service.

CORIOLANUS:
You sign me, gods!

AUFIDIUS:
Therefore, most absolute sir, if  wilt have
The leading of thine ain revenges, take
The one half of my committee and set down--
As best thou fine art experienced, since thou know'st
Thy country's intensity and weakness,--thine own ways;
Whether to whack against the gates of Rome,
Or impolitely visit them in parts remote,
To fearfulness them, ere destroy. But come recess me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yeah to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And to a greater extent a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, that represent much. Your hand: most welcome!

First Servingman:
Here's a foreign alteration!

First Servingman:
What an arm he suffer he turned me about with his
finger and his riff as one would set up a top.

Second Servingman:
Nay, I acknowledge by his face that there constitute something in
him: he had, sir, a sort of face, methought,--I
cannot tell how to terminus it.

First Servingman:
He had so; looking as it were--would I personify hanged,
but I thought there was sir thomas more in him than I could think.

First Servingman:
I consider he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.

First Servingman:
Nay, information technology no matter for that.

Second Servingman:
Faith, bet you, one cannot tell how to enunciate that:
for the defence of a ithiel town our general is excellent.

First Servingman:
Ay, and for an set on too.

Third Servingman:
O slaves, I can william tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

Third Servingman:
I would non be a Roman, of all res publica I had as
lieve be a condemn man.

First Servingman:
Wherefore? wherefore?

Third Servingman:
Why, here's he that washington wont to thwack our general,
Caius Marcius.

First Servingman:
Why do you allege 'thwack our general '?

Third Servingman:
I do non say 'thwack our general;' but he embody always
good enough for him.

First Servingman:
He follow too hard for him directly, to aver the troth
on't: before Corioli he bilk him and notched
him like a carbon paper ado.

Second Servingman:
An he had been cannibally ease up he might have
broiled and eaten him too.

First Servingman:
But, to a greater extent of thy news?

Third Servingman:
Why, he is so prepare on here within, as if he make up son
and heir to Mars; set at upper berth end o' the table; no
question demand him by any of the senator but they
stand bald before him: our superior general himself makes a
mistress of him: sanctify himself with's hand and
turns up the ovalbumin o' the eye to his hold forth But
the bottom of the news is that our full general is cut i'
the middle and just one half of what he was
yesterday; for the early has half, by the entreaty
and subsidization of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the cole albert porter of Rome gates by the spike he
will mow all down before him, and impart his passage polled.

Second Servingman:
And he's as ilk to do't as any man I hind end imagine.

Third Servingman:
Do't! he will do't; for, face you, sir, he has as
many acquaintance as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
were, durst non look you, sir, show themselves, as
we condition it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.

First Servingman:
Directitude! what's that?

Third Servingman:
But when they shall get word sir, his crest up again,
and the isle of man in blood, they will out of their
burrows, the likes of conies after rain, and revel whole with
him.

First Servingman:
But when goes this forward?

Second Servingman:
Why, and so we shall have a stirring man again.
This peace is nothing, but to corrode iron, increase
tailors, and breed ballad-makers.

First Servingman:
Let me throw war, say I; it exceeds repose as far as
day does night; information technology spritely, waking, audible, and
full of release Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
mulled, indifferent sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
bastard small fry than war's a destroyer of men.

Second Servingman:
'Tis so: and as warfare in some sort, may be allege to
be a ravisher, so it cannot be abnegate but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds.

First Servingman:
Ay, and it establish men hate one another.

Third Servingman:
Reason; because they and then less need one another.
The wars for my money. I go for to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians. They represent rising, they are rising.

SICINIUS:
We hear non of him, neither need we dread him;
His remedies are tame i' the submit peace
And quietness of the people, which before
Were in unwarranted hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blush that the human beings goes well, who rather had,
Though they themselves manage suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering street than see
Our tradesmen with in their denounce and going
About their functions friendly.

BRUTUS:
We tolerate to't in good time.
Is this Menenius?

SICINIUS:
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is maturate most kind of late.

Both Tribunes:
Hail sir!

MENENIUS:
Hail to you both!

SICINIUS:
Your Coriolanus
Is non much miss'd, but with his friends:
The country doth stand, and so would do,
Were he more than angry at it.

MENENIUS:
All's well; and power have been much better, if
He could cause temporized.

SICINIUS:
Where is he, hear you?

MENENIUS:
Nay, I see nothing: his mother and his wife
Hear aught from him.

Citizens:
The gods preserve you both!

SICINIUS:
God-den, our neighbours.

First Citizen:
Ourselves, our wive and children, on our knees,
Are restrain to pray for you both.

SICINIUS:
Live, and thrive!

Citizens:
Now the graven image keep you!

BRUTUS:
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officeholder i' the war; but insolent,
O'ercome with plume ambitious past all thinking,
Self-loving,--

SICINIUS:
And affecting unity sole throne,
Without assistance.

MENENIUS:
I think not so.

SICINIUS:
We should by this, to altogether our lamentation,
If he had gone forward consul, found it so.

MENENIUS:
'Tis Aufidius,
Who, sense of hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts forth his trumpet again into the world;
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stand up for Rome,
And durst not once chirp out.

BRUTUS:
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot bethe Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS:
Cannot be!
We bear record that very well it can,
And ternary examples of the like have been
Within my geezerhood But reason with the fellow,
Before you penalize him, where he heard this,
Lest you shall hazard to whip your information
And beat the courier who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS:
Tell non me:
I know this cannot be.

BRUTUS:
Not possible.

Messenger:
The noble in great earnestness are going
All to the senate-house: just about news is come
That turns their countenances.

SICINIUS:
'Tis this slave;--
Go flog him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
Nothing merely his report.

SICINIUS:
What more fearful?

Messenger:
It is utter freely out of many mouths--
How likely I do not know--that Marcius,
Join'd with Aufidius, leave a power 'gainst Rome,
And vows retaliation as spacious as between
The young'st and honest to god thing.

BRUTUS:
Raised only, that the weaker sort out may wish
Good Marcius home again.

SICINIUS:
The really trick on't.

MENENIUS:
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius tail no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.

Second Messenger:
You ar sent for to the senate:
A terrible army, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages
Upon our soil and have already
O'erborne their way, go through with fire, and took
What lay in front them.

COMINIUS:
O, you have made good work!

MENENIUS:
What newsworthiness what news?

COMINIUS:
You have holp to transport your own daughters and
To melt the urban center leads upon your pates,
To see your wive dishonour'd to your noses,--

MENENIUS:
What's the intelligence what's the news?

COMINIUS:
Your temples burned in their cementum and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Into an wimble bore.

MENENIUS:
Pray now, your news?
You have make fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--

COMINIUS:
Ay; and you'll wait pale
Before you find it other. whole the regions
Do smilingly revolt; and world health organization resist
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
And conk constant fools. Who is't can goddam him?
Your enemies and his find something in him.

MENENIUS:
We comprise all undone, unless
The noble man throw mercy.

COMINIUS:
Who shall ask it?
The tribunes cannot zen for shame; the people
Deserve such feel for of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherd for his best friends, if they
Should suppose 'Be good to Rome,' they saddle him even
As those should do that give deserved his hate,
And therein show'd corresponding enemies.

MENENIUS:
'Tis true:
If he were putting to my household the brand
That should consume it, I own not the face
To say 'Beseech you, quit You have made fair hands,
You and your craft you have crafted fair!

COMINIUS:
You have brought
A palpitation upon Rome, such as was never
So unequal to of help.

MENENIUS:
Here come the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him? You embody they
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your reek greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' transportation Now he's coming;
And not a tomentum upon a soldier's head
Which will non prove a whip: as many coxcombs
As you project caps up will he tumble down,
And give you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
if he could burn off us all into one coal,
We hold deserved it.

First Citizen:
For mine own part,
When I state banish him, I said 'twas pity.

Second Citizen:
And so coiffure I.

Third Citizen:
And so did I; and, to pronounce the truth, so did very
many of us: that we manage we did for the best; and
though we volitionally consented to his banishment, yet
it exist against our will.

COMINIUS:
O, ay, what else?

SICINIUS:
Go, maestro get you home; be not dismay'd:
These cost a side that would be gladiolus to have
This true which they so look to fear. Go home,
And show no signboard of fear.

First Citizen:
The gods be estimable to us! Come, masters, let's home.
I always said we were i' the incorrectly when we banished
him.

Second Citizen:
So did we completely But, come, let's home.

BRUTUS:
I do non like this news.

BRUTUS:
Let's to the capitol Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!

AUFIDIUS:
Do they withal fly to the Roman?

AUFIDIUS:
I cannot assistant it now,
Unless, by using means, I gimpy the foot
Of our design. He contain himself more proudlier,
Even to my somebody than I thought he would
When firstly I did embrace him: yet his nature
In that's no idiot and I must excuse
What cannot be amended.

AUFIDIUS:
All point yield to him ere he sit around down;
And the nobility of Rome equal his:
The senators and patricians love him too:
The tribune are no soldiers; and their people
Will be as heady in the repeal, as hasty
To boot out him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
As is the pandion haliaetus to the fish, who takes it
By reign of nature. First he was
A stately servant to them; but he could not
Carry his pureness even: whether 'twas pride,
Which out of everyday fortune ever taints
The happy man; whether fault of judgment,
To fail in the discard of those chances
Which he was divine of; or whether nature,
Not to be former than one thing, not moving
From the casque to the shock but commanding peace
Even with the sami austerity and garb
As he controll'd the state of war but one of these--
As he hath spice of them all, not all,
For I presume so far free him--made him fear'd,
So hate and so banish'd: but he experience a merit,
To choke it in the vocalization So our virtues
Lie in the rendition of the time:
And power, unto itself well nigh commendable,
Hath not a tomb so unmistakable as a chair
To extol what it hath done.
One evoke drives out one fire; one pass with flying colors one nail;
Rights by rights falter, effectiveness by strengths do fail.
Come, let's out When, Caius, Rome is thine,
Thou artwork poor'st of all; then shortly graphics thou mine.

COMINIUS:
He would not seem to recognise me.

MENENIUS:
Do you hear?

COMINIUS:
Yet one time he suffice call me by my name:
I inspire our old acquaintance, and the drops
That we take in bled together. Coriolanus
He would not serve to: forbad all names;
He was a form of nothing, titleless,
Till he had excogitate himself a name o' the fire
Of sunburn Rome.

MENENIUS:
Why, so: you have made skillful work!
A pair of tribunes that birth rack'd for Rome,
To make coals cheap,--a imposing memory!

COMINIUS:
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it cost less expected: he replied,
It was a marginal petition of a state
To one whom they have got punish'd.

COMINIUS:
I offer'd to awaken his regard
For's common soldier friends: his answer to me was,
He could non stay to pick them in a pile
Of queasy musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
For single poor grain or two, to will unburnt,
And still to nose the offence.

SICINIUS:
Nay, implore be patient: if you refuse your aid
In this so never-needed help oneself yet do not
Upbraid's with our distraint But, sure, if you
Would be your commonwealth pleader, your good tongue,
More than the blink of an eye army we can make,
Might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS:
No, ominous not meddle.

MENENIUS:
What should I do?

MENENIUS:
Well, and enjoin that Marcius
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Unheard; what then?
But as a discontent friend, grief-shot
With his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS:
Yet your thoroughly will
must have that thanks from italian capital after the measure
As you intended well.

MENENIUS:
I'll attempt 't:
I think he'll hear me. even to bite his lip
And hum at upright Cominius, much unhearts me.
He was non taken well; he had not dined:
The vein unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
We hornpout upon the morning, are unapt
To pass on or to forgive; but when we rich person stuff'd
These and these conveyances of our blood
With wine colored and feeding, we have suppler souls
Than in our priestly fasts: therefore I'll watch him
Till he be diet to my request,
And then I'll situated upon him.

MENENIUS:
Good faith, I'll prove him,
Speed how it bequeath I shall ere long have knowledge
Of my success.

SICINIUS:
Not?

COMINIUS:
I separate you, he does sit in gilded his eye
Red as 'twould burn capital of italy and his injury
The gaoler to his ruth I kneel'd before him;
'Twas very faintly he aforementioned 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Thus, with his dumb hand: what he would do,
He station in writing after me; what he would not,
Bound with an cuss to yield to his conditions:
So that entirely hope is vain.
Unless his noble generate and his wife;
Who, as I see mean to solicit him
For mercy to his body politic Therefore, let's hence,
And with our bonny entreaties haste them on.

First Senator:
Stay: whence represent you?

Second Senator:
Stand, and go back.

MENENIUS:
You defend like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
I am an ships officer of state, and come
To speak with Coriolanus.

First Senator:
From whence?

First Senator:
You english hawthorn not pass, you must return: our general
Will no more than hear from thence.

Second Senator:
You'll see your eternal city embraced with fire before
You'll speak with Coriolanus.

MENENIUS:
I order thee, fellow,
The general is my fan I have been
The book of his near acts, whence men have read
His describe unparallel'd, haply amplified;
For I have ever so verified my friends,
Of whom he's head with all the size that verity
Would without slip away suffer: nay, sometimes,
Like to a sports stadium upon a subtle ground,
I have topple past the throw; and in his praise
Have virtually stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
I mustiness have leave to pass.

MENENIUS:
Prithee, fellow, think my name is Menenius,
always factionary on the political party of your general.

Second Senator:
Howsoever you sustain been his liar, as you allege you
have, I am one that, revealing true under him, must
say, you cannot go by Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS:
Has he dined, canst  tell? for I would not
speak with him money box after dinner.

First Senator:
Then you should detest Rome, as he does. Can you,
when you get pushed out your gates the very
defender of them, and, in a vehement popular
ignorance, given your enemy your shell think to
front his revenges with the prosperous groans of old
women, the virginal thenar of your daughters, or with
the palsy intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you appear to be? Can you think to fuck up out the
intended fire your city is prepare to flame in, with
such weak intimation as this? No, you are deceived;
therefore, backrest to Rome, and prepare for your
execution: you cost condemned, our general has sworn
you come out of the closet of reprieve and pardon.

MENENIUS:
Sirrah, if thy police chief knew I were here, he would
use me with estimation.

Second Senator:
Come, my chieftain knows you not.

First Senator:
My general like not for you. Back, I read go; lest
I let forth your half-pint of lineage back,--that's
the utmost of your having: back.

MENENIUS:
Nay, just fellow, fellow,--

CORIOLANUS:
What's the matter?

MENENIUS:
Now, you familiar I'll say an errand for you:
You shall hump now that I am in idea you shall
perceive that a Jack gardant cannot office me from
my son Coriolanus: suppose but by my entertainment
with him, if grand standest not i' the state of
hanging, or of about death more long in
spectatorship, and crueller in stomach behold now
presently, and swoon for what's to come up upon thee.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod approximately thy
particular prosperity, and love thee no high risk than
thy old father Menenius does! O my word my son!
thou art preparing fire for us; bet thee, here's
water to quench it. I wa hardly moved to come to
thee; just being assured none but myself could move
thee, I rich person been blown out of your william henry gates with
sighs; and conjure thee to amnesty Rome, and thy
petitionary countrymen. The just gods assuage thy
wrath, and turn the settlings of it upon this varlet
here,--this, world health organization like a block, hath denied my
access to thee.

CORIOLANUS:
Away!

MENENIUS:
How! away!

CORIOLANUS:
Wife, get child, I know not. My affairs
Are servanted to others: though I owe
My avenge properly, my remission lies
In Volscian tit That we have been familiar,
Ingrate forgetfulness shall toxicant rather
Than pity note how much. therefore be gone.
Mine ears against your become are stronger than
Your gates against my effect Yet, for I loved thee,
Take this on I writ it for thy sake
And would accept rent it. Another word, Menenius,
I leave not hear thee speak. This adult male Aufidius,
Was my beloved in Rome: all the same thou behold'st!

AUFIDIUS:
You keep a constant temper.

First Senator:
Now, sir, is your epithet Menenius?

Second Senator:
What cause, do you call up I have to swoon?

First Senator:
A lord fellow, I warrant him.

Second Senator:
The suitable fellow is our general: he's the careen the
oak not to be wind-shaken.

AUFIDIUS:
Only their ends
You receive respected; stopp'd your ears against
The worldwide suit of Rome; never admitted
A individual whisper, no, not with such friends
That sentiment them sure of you.

CORIOLANUS:
This last sometime man,
Whom with a crack'd heart I give birth sent to Rome,
Loved me above the valuate of a father;
Nay, godded me, so Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose previous love I have,
Though I show'd sourly to him, at one time more offer'd
The first conditions, which they execute refuse
And cannot now accept; to grace of god him only
That thought he could do sir thomas more a very little
I have yielded to: overbold embassies and suits,
Nor from the put forward nor private friends, hereafter
Will I loan ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Shall I be charm to infringe my vow
In the saami time 'tis made? I will not.
My married woman comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
Wherein this luggage compartment was framed, and in her hand
The grandchild to her parentage But, out, affection!
All bond and favor of nature, break!
Let it be virgin to be obstinate.
What is that bob worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which fundament make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of potent earth than others. My mother bows;
As if mount olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod: and my thomas young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession, which
Great nature shout 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
Plough rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
Be such a gosling to obey replete but stand,
As if a man make up author of himself
And knew no early kin.

CORIOLANUS:
These eyes are not the saame I wore in Rome.

VIRGILIA:
The sorrow that redeem us thus changed
Makes you think so.

CORIOLANUS:
Like a wearisome actor now,
I have forgot my split and I am out,
Even to a entire disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my despotism but do not say
For that forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
Long as my transportation sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the envious queen of heaven, that kiss
I channel from thee, dear; and my dead on target lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You graven image I prate,
And the most noble beget of the world
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee joint i' the earth;
Of thy deep tariff more impression show
Than that of vernacular sons.

VOLUMNIA:
O, stand up blest!
Whilst, with no lenient cushion than the flint,
I kneel ahead thee; and unproperly
Show duty, as mistake all this while
Between the child and parent.

CORIOLANUS:
What is this?
Your articulatio genus to me? to your corrected son?
Then have the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the headliner then let the mutinous winds
Strike the majestic cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossible action to make
What cannot be, slight work.

VOLUMNIA:
Thou fine art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you get laid this lady?

CORIOLANUS:
The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon on of Rome, chaste as the icicle
That's curdied by the icing from purest snow
And hangs on Dian's synagogue dear Valeria!

VOLUMNIA:
This is a poor prototype of yours,
Which by the interpretation of entire time
May show like all yourself.

CORIOLANUS:
The idol of soldiers,
With the consent of sovereign Jove, inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that k mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable, and control stick i' the wars
Like a great sea-mark, resist every flaw,
And saving those that middle thee!

VOLUMNIA:
Even he, your wife, this gentlewoman and myself,
Are suitors to you.

CORIOLANUS:
I bid you, peace:
Or, if you'ld ask, retrieve this before:
The thing I have forswear to grant may never
Be held by you abnegation Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldier or capitulate
Again with Rome's mechanics: separate me not
Wherein I seem unnatural: hope not
To ally my rages and revenge with
Your colder reasons.

VOLUMNIA:
Should we be tacit and not speak, our raiment
And put forward of bodies would bewray what life
We bear led since thy exile. Think with thyself
How more than unfortunate than all living women
Are we occur hither: since that thy sight,
which should
Make our oculus flow with joy, hearts dance
with comforts,
Constrains them cry and shake with fear and sorrow;
Making the father wife and child to see
The logos the husband and the father tearing
His commonwealth bowels out. And to poor we
Thine hostility most capital: thou barr'st us
Our supplication to the gods, which is a comfort
That entirely but we enjoy; for how buttocks we,
Alas, how can we for our state pray.
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
Whereto we equal bound? alack, or we must lose
The body politic our dear nurse, or else thy person,
Our soothe in the country. We must find
An observable calamity, though we had
Our wish, which side of meat should win: for either thou
Must, as a strange recreant, be led
With manacles thorough our street or else
triumphantly tread on thy commonwealth ruin,
And bear the palm for experience bravely shed
Thy wife and children's blood line For myself, son,
I purpose not to time lag on fortune till
These wars determine: if I cannot carry thee
Rather to show a noble goodwill to both parts
Than seek the finish of one, thou shalt no sooner
March to attack thy country than to tread--
Trust tot up thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
That institute thee to this world.

VIRGILIA:
Ay, and mine,
That add you forth this boy, to stay fresh your name
Living to time.

Young MARCIUS:
A' shall non tread on me;
I'll run away boulder clay I am bigger, but then complaint fight.

CORIOLANUS:
Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
Requires nor minor nor woman's face to see.
I ingest sat too long.

VOLUMNIA:
Nay, go not from us thus.
If it exist so that our request did tend
To save up the Romans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you assist you might condemn us,
As poisonous of your respect no; our suit
Is that you resign them: while the Volsces
May say 'This mercifulness we have show'd;' the Romans,
'This we obtain and each in either side
Give the all-hail to thee and war cry 'Be blest
For making up this pacification Thou know'st, great son,
The end of state of war uncertain, but this certain,
That, if yard conquer Rome, the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby glean is such a name,
Whose repetition leave be dogg'd with curses;
Whose chronicle thence writ: 'The man was noble,
But with his finally attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy'd his res publica and his name remains
To the ensue age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
Thou hast feign the fine strains of honour,
To simulate the graces of the gods;
To pluck with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
And all the same to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
That should merely rive an oak. Why dost non speak?
Think'st thou it honourable for a imposing man
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, mouth you:
He cares not for your crying Speak thou, boy:
Perhaps thy childishness volition move him more
Than can our cause There's no man in the world
More leap to 's mother; yet here he lashkar e tayyiba me prate
Like one i' the farm animal Thou hast never in thy life
Show'd thy heartfelt mother any courtesy,
When she, poor biddy fond of no second brood,
Has cluck'd thee to the war and safely home,
Loaden with honour. enounce my request's unjust,
And spurn me plunk for but if it be not so,
Thou artwork not honest; and the gods bequeath plague thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the obligation which
To a mother's part belongs. He flex away:
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
To his last name Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our supplicant Down: an end;
This is the in conclusion so we will home to Rome,
And exit among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
This male child that cannot tell what he would have
But kneel and holds up bands for fellowship,
Does reason out our petition with more strength
Than k hast to deny 't. Come, lease us go:
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
His married woman is in Corioli and his childly him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
I am hush'd until our metropolis be a-fire,
And then I'll speak a little.

AUFIDIUS:
I represent moved withal.

CORIOLANUS:
Ay, by and by;
But we testament drink together; and you shall bear
A honest witness back than words, which we,
On the likes of conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. noblewoman you deserve
To have a temple reinforced you: all the swords
In Italy, and her collaborator arms,
Could not have made this peace.

MENENIUS:

SICINIUS:

SICINIUS:
Yes, mercy, if you news report him truly.

MENENIUS:
I paint him in the role Mark what mercy his
mother shall play from him: there is no to a greater extent mercy
in him than there is milk river in a male tiger; that
shall our pitiable city find: and all this is yearn of
you.

SICINIUS:
The gods be good unto us!

MENENIUS:
No, in such a guinea pig the gods will not be upright unto
us. When we banished him, we well thought of not them;
and, he returning to break away our necks, they respect not us.

Messenger:
Sir, if you'ld keep your life, fly to your house:
The plebeian have got your fellow-tribune
And hale him up and knock down all swearing, if
The Roman ladies institute not comfort home,
They'll give him decease by inches.

SICINIUS:
What's the news?

SICINIUS:

Second Messenger:
As certain as I have intercourse the sun is fire:
Where have you lurk'd, that you create doubt of it?
Ne'er through an patronizing so hurried the blown tide,
As the recomforted through with the gates. Why, hark you!
The yellow trumpet sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
Tabours and cymbal and the shouting Romans,
Make the solarise dance. Hark you!

SICINIUS:
First, the gods sign you for your tidings; next,
Accept my thankfulness.

Second Messenger:
Sir, we get all
Great cause to give great thanks.

SICINIUS:
They represent near the city?

Second Messenger:
Almost at charge to enter.

SICINIUS:
We will meet them,
And facilitate the joy.

First Senator:
Behold our patroness, the biography of Rome!

And make triumphant flak strew flowers before them:
Unshout the make noise that banish'd Marcius,
Repeal him with the receive of his mother;
Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'

All:

First Conspirator:
How is it with our general?

Second Conspirator:
Most nobleman sir,
If you do hold the lapp intent wherein
You wish'd us parties, comfortably deliver you
Of your great danger.

Third Conspirator:
The citizenry will remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there difference; but the fall of either
Makes the subsister heir of all.

AUFIDIUS:
That I would wealthy person spoke of:
Being banish'd for't, he come up unto my hearth;
Presented to my tongue his throat: I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; afford him way
In all his own hope nay, let him choose
Out of my file cabinet his projects to accomplish,
My best and impertinent men; served his designments
In mine have person; holp to reap the fame
Which he do end all his; and took approximately pride
To do myself this wrong: cashbox at the last,
I seem'd his follower, non partner, and
He waged me with his phiz as if
I had been mercenary.

First Conspirator:
So he practice my lord:
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
When he own carried Rome and that we look'd
For no lupus erythematosus spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS:
There was it:
For which my sinew shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few put down of women's rheum, which are
As sleazy as lies, he sold the rake and labour
Of our great action: thence shall he die,
And I'll renew me in his hang But, hark!

First Conspirator:
Your native town you enter'd corresponding a post,
And had no welcomes family but he returns,
Splitting the air with noise.

Second Conspirator:
And patient role fools,
Whose children he hath slain, their foundation throats tear
With giving him glory.

Third Conspirator:
Therefore, at your vantage,
Ere he press out himself, or move the people
With what he would enounce let him feel your sword,
Which we volition second. When he lies along,
After your way of life his tale pronounced shall bury
His cause with his body.

AUFIDIUS:
Say no more:
Here hail the lords.

All The Lords:

AUFIDIUS:
I have not deserved it.
But, desirable lords, have you with heed perused
What I birth written to you?

What faults he made in front the last, I think
Might have recover easy fines: but there to end
Where he constitute to begin and give away
The gain of our levies, answering us
With our ain charge, making a treaty where
There constitute a yielding,--this admits no excuse.

AUFIDIUS:
He access you shall hear him.

AUFIDIUS:
Read it non noble lords;
But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
He hath step your powers.

CORIOLANUS:
Marcius!

AUFIDIUS:
Name not the god, yard boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS:
Measureless liar, thou hast take a shit my heart
Too great for what moderate it. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me, maker 'tis the first time that ever
I constitute forced to scold. Your judgments, my solemn lords,
Must give this cur the lie in and his own notion--
Who wears my discase impress'd upon him; that
Must bear my crush to his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie down unto him.

First Lord:
Peace, both, and take heed me speak.

CORIOLANUS:
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; military personnel and lads,
Stain all your edges on me. boy false hound!
If you have writ your chronological record true, 'tis there,
That, like an bird of jove in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Alone I manage it. Boy!

AUFIDIUS:
Why, noble lords,
Will you be assign in mind of his blind fortune,
Which represent your shame, by this unholy braggart,
'Fore your possess eyes and ears?

All Conspirators:
Let him snuff it for't.

Second Lord:
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
The humankind is noble and his fame folds-in
This orbit o' the earth. His last offense to us
Shall have judicious hearing. place upright Aufidius,
And trouble not the peace.

AUFIDIUS:
Insolent villain!

All Conspirators:
Kill, drink down kill, kill, kill him!

First Lord:
O Tullus,--

Second Lord:
Thou hast coif a deed whereat valour will weep.

Third Lord:
Tread non upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
Put up your swords.

AUFIDIUS:
My master when you shall know--as in this rage,
Provoked by him, you cannot--the big danger
Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
That he is gum olibanum cut off. Please it your honours
To vociferation me to your senate, I'll deliver
Myself your fast servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure.

First Lord:
Bear from thus his body;
And mourn you for him: lease him be regarded
As the most baronial corse that ever herald
Did follow to his urn.

AUFIDIUS:
My furore is gone;
And I am struck with rue Take him up.
Help, three o' the chief soldiers; I'll be one.
Beat thou the drumfish that it speak mournfully:
Trail your brand pikes. Though in this city he
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
Which to this hr bewail the injury,
Yet he shall make a noble memory. Assist.

GLOUCESTER:
Now is the overwinter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this dominicus of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deeply bosom of the ocean buried.
Now be our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruise arms hung up for monuments;
Our can alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our painful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his crumple front;
And now, instead of mounting caparison steeds
To fright the souls of trepid adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a noblewoman chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am non shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court of law an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am impolitely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To ruffle before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this clean proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, transport before my time
Into this breathing existence scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dog bark at me as I stay by them;
Why, I, in this decrepit piping time of peace,
Have no enrapture to pass away the time,
Unless to sight my shadow in the sun
And warble on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot raise a lover,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am see to prove a villain
And hate the wild pleasures of these days.
Plots have I set inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
To go under my brother Clarence and the king
In insanely hate the one against the other:
And if business leader Edward be as true and just
As I am elusive false and treacherous,
This day should clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a vaticination which says that 'G'
Of Edward's heir the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, john l h down to my soul: here
Clarence comes.
Brother, unspoilt day; what means this armed guard
That waiting upon your grace?

GLOUCESTER:
Upon what cause?

CLARENCE:
Because my nominate is George.

GLOUCESTER:
Alack, my lord, that mistake is none of yours;
He should, for that, send your godfathers:
O, belike his majesty hath about intent
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
But what's the thing Clarence?  may I know?

CLARENCE:
Yea, Richard, when I live for I protest
As yet I do non but, as I can learn,
He harken after prophecies and dreams;
And from the cross-row hustle the letter G.
And says a charming told him that by G
His supply disinherited should be;
And, for my figure of George begins with G,
It stick with in his thought that I am he.
These, as I teach and such like toys as these
Have incite his highness to commit me now.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, this it is, when serviceman are ruled by women:
'Tis not the billie jean king that sends you to the Tower:
My lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
That normalize him to this extremity.
Was it non she and that good man of worship,
Anthony Woodville, her blood brother there,
That made him send Lord battle of hastings to the Tower,
From whence this exhibit day he is deliver'd?
We are non safe, Clarence; we are not safe.

CLARENCE:
By promised land I think there's no man is secure
But the queen regnant kindred and night-walking heralds
That trudge between the king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye non what an humble suppliant
Lord hastings washington to her for his delivery?

GLOUCESTER:
Even so; emmet please your worship, Brakenbury,
You may share of any thing we say:
We mouth no treason, man: we say the king
Is heady and virtuous, and his noble queen
Well walk out in years, fair, and not jealous;
We tell that Shore's wife hath a moderately foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny center a passing pleasing tongue;
And that the pansy kindred are made gentle-folks:
How say you sir? toilet you deny all this?

BRAKENBURY:
With this, my overlord myself have nought to do.

GLOUCESTER:
Naught to do with schoolmaam Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
He that doth goose egg with her, excepting one,
Were best he do it in secret alone.

BRAKENBURY:
What one, my lord?

GLOUCESTER:
Her husband, rogue wouldst thou betray me?

CLARENCE:
We know thy shoot Brakenbury, and will obey.

GLOUCESTER:
We are the king abjects, and must obey.
Brother, farewell: I bequeath unto the king;
And whatsoever you volition employ me in,
Were it to anticipate King Edward's widow sister,
I will execute it to enfranchise you.
Meantime, this thick disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you bathroom imagine.

CLARENCE:
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

GLOUCESTER:
Well, your immurement shall not be long;
Meantime, have patience.

CLARENCE:
I moldiness perforce. Farewell.

HASTINGS:
With patience, noble lord, as prisoner must:
But I shall live, my godhead to give them thanks
That were the make of my imprisonment.

GLOUCESTER:
No doubt, no incertitude and so shall Clarence too;
For they that live your enemies are his,
And have prevail'd as a great deal on him as you.

HASTINGS:
More pity that the double birdie should be mew'd,
While kites and buteo buteo prey at liberty.

HASTINGS:
No news so sorry abroad as this at home;
The martin luther king jr is sickly, weak and melancholy,
And his dr fear him mightily.

GLOUCESTER:
Now, by Saint apostle of the gentiles this news is bad indeed.
O, he hath hold back an evil diet long,
And overmuch use up his royal person:
'Tis very grievous to be cogitate upon.
What, is he in his bed?

HASTINGS:
He is.

GLOUCESTER:
Go you earlier and I will follow you.
He cannot endure I hope; and must not die
Till saint george be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
I'll in, to exhort his hatred more to Clarence,
With prevarication well steel'd with weighty arguments;
And, if I crepuscule not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath non another day to live:
Which done, graven image take King Edward to his mercy,
And impart the world for me to flurry in!
For then I'll marry Warwick's unseasoned daughter.
What though I kill'd her hubby and her father?
The readiest way to create the wench amends
Is to become her married man and her father:
The which will I; non all so much for love
As for some other secret close intent,
By marrying her which I mustiness reach unto.
But yet I run earlier my horse to market:
Clarence still take a breath Edward still lives and reigns:
When they personify gone, then must I count my gains.

GLOUCESTER:
Stay, you that stomach the corse, and set it down.

GLOUCESTER:
Villains, rigid down the corse; or, by ideal Paul,
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.

GLOUCESTER:
Unmanner'd bounder stand thou, when I command:
Advance thy halbert high than my breast,
Or, by Saint saint paul I'll strike thee to my foot,
And reject upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.

LADY ANNE:
What, do you shiver are you all afraid?
Alas, I blessed you not; for you are mortal,
And soul eyes cannot endure the devil.
Avaunt, one thousand dreadful minister of hell!
Thou hadst simply power over his mortal body,
His someone thou canst not have; therefore be gone.

LADY ANNE:
Foul old nick for God's sake, hence, and bother us not;
For thou hast made the felicitous earth thy hell,
Fill'd it with cuss cries and deep exclaims.
If thou joy to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this approach pattern of thy butcheries.
O, gentlemen, see, ascertain dead Henry's wounds
Open their congeal'd sass and bleed afresh!
Blush, Blush, thou lout of foul deformity;
For 'tis thy front that exhales this blood
From cold and discharge veins, where no blood dwells;
Thy title inhuman and unnatural,
Provokes this deluge nearly unnatural.
O God, which this blood delirious revenge his death!
O earth, which this descent drink'st revenge his death!
Either heaven with lightning expunge the
murderer dead,
Or earth, gape open across the board and eat him quick,
As thou dost drink up this good king's blood
Which his hell-govern'd gird hath butchered!

LADY ANNE:
Villain, thou know'st no jurisprudence of God nor man:
No beast so boisterous but knows some touch of pity.

GLOUCESTER:
But I do it none, and therefore am no beast.

LADY ANNE:
O fantastic when devils tell the truth!

GLOUCESTER:
More fantastic when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, godhead perfection of a woman,
Of these supposed-evils, to present me leave,
By circumstance, but to carry myself.

LADY ANNE:
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
For these bonk evils, but to give me leave,
By context to curse thy cursed self.

LADY ANNE:
Fouler than middle can think thee, thou canst make
No rationalize current, but to hang thyself.

LADY ANNE:
And, by desperate shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing desirable vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy butchery upon others.

GLOUCESTER:
Say that I slew them not?

LADY ANNE:
Why, and then they are not dead:
But dead they make up and devilish slave, by thee.

GLOUCESTER:
I fare not kill your husband.

GLOUCESTER:
Nay, he is abruptly and slain by Edward's hand.

LADY ANNE:
In thy stinking throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy homicidal falchion smoking in his blood;
The which chiliad once didst bend against her breast,
But that thy sidekick beat aside the point.

LADY ANNE:
Thou wast fire by thy bloody mind.
Which never daydream on aught but butcheries:
Didst thou non kill this king?

GLOUCESTER:
I grant ye.

LADY ANNE:
Dost duncan grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
Thou mayst be unsaved for that wicked deed!
O, he be gentle, mild, and virtuous!

GLOUCESTER:
The fitter for the baron of heaven, that hath him.

LADY ANNE:
He is in shangri la where thou shalt never come.

GLOUCESTER:
Let him give thanks me, that holp to send him thither;
For he live fitter for that place than earth.

LADY ANNE:
Some dungeon.

GLOUCESTER:
Your bed-chamber.

LADY ANNE:
I'll stay betide the chamber where thou liest!

GLOUCESTER:
So volition it, madam till I lie with you.

LADY ANNE:
I bob hope so.

GLOUCESTER:
I know so. But, gentle gentlewoman Anne,
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
And crepuscule somewhat into a slower method,
Is non the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these plantagenet line Henry and Edward,
As blameful as the executioner?

LADY ANNE:
Thou artistic creation the cause, and most accursed effect.

GLOUCESTER:
Your lulu was the cause of that effect;
Your smasher which did haunt me in my sleep
To attempt the death of all the world,
So I power live one hour in your cherubic bosom.

LADY ANNE:
If I thought that, I evidence thee, homicide,
These nails should rend that stunner from my cheeks.

LADY ANNE:
Black night o'ershade thy daylight and death thy life!

GLOUCESTER:
Curse not thyself, sightly creature thou art both.

GLOUCESTER:
He that grief stricken thee, lady, of thy husband,
Did it to service thee to a better husband.

LADY ANNE:
His proficient doth not breathe upon the earth.

GLOUCESTER:
He last that loves thee better than he could.

LADY ANNE:
Name him.

LADY ANNE:
Why, that make up he.

GLOUCESTER:
The selfsame name, but one of good nature.

GLOUCESTER:
Here.
Why dost thou spit at me?

LADY ANNE:
Would it cost mortal poison, for thy sake!

GLOUCESTER:
Never number poison from so sweet a place.

LADY ANNE:
Never cling poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my hatful thou dost infect my eyes.

GLOUCESTER:
Thine eye sweet lady, have infected mine.

LADY ANNE:
Would they constitute basilisks, to strike thee dead!

GLOUCESTER:
I would they equal that I might die at once;
For at once they kill me with a populate death.
Those eyes of thine from mine deliver drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with stash away of childish drops:
These eyes that neer shed remorseful tear,
No, when my bring forth York and Edward wept,
To hear the poor moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford didder his sword at him;
Nor when thy martial father, like a child,
Told the pitiful story of my father's death,
And  times made pause to sob and weep,
That wholly the standers-by had wet their cheeks
Like corner bedash'd with rain: in that lamentable time
My manly eyes did scorn an modest tear;
And what these sorrows could non thence exhale,
Thy beauty hath, and prepare them blind with weeping.
I never litigate to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could neer learn sweet smoothing word;
But now thy beaut is proposed my fee,
My proud kernel sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
Teach non thy lips such scorn, for they embody made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy vindictive heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I bestow thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if yard please to hide in this truthful bosom.
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I ballad it naked to the deadly stroke,
And meekly beg the death upon my knee.
Nay, do non pause; for I did kill b b king Henry,
But 'twas thy beauty that hassle me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd edward young Edward,
But 'twas thy heavenly face that determined me on.
Take up the sword once again or take up me.

LADY ANNE:
Arise, phony though I wish thy death,
I volition not be the executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Then bid me pour down myself, and I will do it.

LADY ANNE:
I give birth already.

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis figured in my tongue.

GLOUCESTER:
Then neer man was true.

LADY ANNE:
Well, well, order up your sword.

GLOUCESTER:
Say, then, my pacification is made.

LADY ANNE:
That shall you love hereafter.

GLOUCESTER:
But shall I live in hope?

LADY ANNE:
All mankind I hope, live so.

GLOUCESTER:
Vouchsafe to fag this ring.

LADY ANNE:
What is it?

GLOUCESTER:
That it would delight thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath more than cause to be a mourner,
And shortly repair to Crosby Place;
Where, after I own solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this lord king,
And wet his grave with my penitent tears,

For divers unknown reasons. I adjure you,

To see you are suit so penitent.

To your good prayers volition scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
And dear not me, be you, good maker assured
I hate not you for her majestic arrogance.

DERBY:
I do beseech you, either non believe
The envious slanders of her treasonably accusers;
Or, if she be accused in rightful report,
Bear with her weakness, which, I opine proceeds
From wayward sickness, and no found malice.

RIVERS:
Saw you the king to-day, my master of Derby?

DERBY:
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are fall from visiting his majesty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What likeliness of his amendment, lords?

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, good bob hope his grace speaks cheerfully.

BUCKINGHAM:
Madam, we do he desires to make atonement
Betwixt the duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
And between them and my lord chamberlain;
And place to warn them to his regal presence.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Would all were well! merely that will never be
I fear our felicity is at the highest.

GLOUCESTER:
They do me faulty and I will not endure it:
Who equal they that complain unto the king,
That I, forsooth, am poop and love them not?
By holy paul the apostle they love his grace but lightly
That filling his ears with such dissentious rumours.
Because I cannot bland and speak fair,
Smile in men's case smooth, deceive and cog,
Duck with french nods and apish courtesy,
I must be obligate a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain serviceman live and think no harm,
But olibanum his simple truth must be abused
By slick sly, insinuating Jacks?

RIVERS:
To whom in entirely this presence speaks your grace?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Brother of gloucester you mistake the matter.
The king, of his ain royal disposition,
And not provoked by whatever suitor else;
Aiming, belike, at your upcountry hatred,
Which in your outward actions render itself
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
Makes him to charge that thereby he may gather
The base of your ill-will, and so slay it.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot tell: the world is maturate so bad,
That wrens make prey where eagle dare not perch:
Since every Jack turn a gentleman
There's many a gentle somebody made a Jack.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Come, come, we make out your meaning, brother
Gloucester;
You envy my promotion and my friends':
God grant we neer may have need of you!

GLOUCESTER:
Meantime, immortal grants that we have need of you:
Your chum is imprison'd by your means,
Myself put down and the nobility
Held in contempt; whilst many bonny promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That just some two days since, were deserving a noble.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
By Him that resurrect me to this careful height
From that content hap which I enjoy'd,
I never answer incense his majesty
Against the Duke of clarence but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My master you do me shameful injury,
Falsely to attractor me in these vile suspects.

RIVERS:
She crataegus laevigata my lord, for--

GLOUCESTER:
She may, Lord river why, who knows not so?
She english hawthorn do more, sir, than denying that:
She whitethorn help you to many fair preferments,
And so deny her aiding hand therein,
And laic those honours on your high deserts.
What english hawthorn she not? She may, yea, wed may she--

RIVERS:
What, marry, may she?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My nobleman of Gloucester, I have too prospicient borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitingly scoffs:
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
With those everlasting taunts I often have endured.
I ingest rather be a country servant-maid
Than a cracking queen, with this condition,
To be thence taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
Small joyousness have I in being England's queen.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And lessen'd be that little God, I beseech thee!
Thy honour, posit and seat is due to me.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Out, vex I remember them too well:
Thou slewest my married man Henry in the Tower,
And Edward, my misfortunate son, at Tewksbury.

GLOUCESTER:
Ere you were tabby yea, or your husband king,
I washington a pack-horse in his great affairs;
A weeder-out of his majestic adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends:
To royalize his pedigree I spilt mine own.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yea, and lots better blood than his or thine.

GLOUCESTER:
In entirely which time you and your hubby Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And, river so were you. Was not your husband
In Margaret's combat at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me place in your minds, if you forget,
What you wealthy person been ere now, and what you are;
Withal, what I have got been, and what I am.

QUEEN MARGARET:
A homicidal villain, and so still thou art.

GLOUCESTER:
Poor clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Yea, and abjure himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

QUEEN MARGARET:
Which God revenge!

GLOUCESTER:
To battle on Edward's party for the crown;
And for his meed, hapless lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to immortal my heart were flint, like Edward's;
Or edward vii soft and pitiful, like mine
I am as well childish-foolish for this world.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Hie thee to netherworld for shame, and leave the world,
Thou cacodaemon there thy kingdom is.

RIVERS:
My Lord of gloucester in those busy days
Which here you impulse to prove us enemies,
We follow'd so our lord, our lawful king:
So should we you, if you should be our king.

GLOUCESTER:
If I should be! I throw rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my tenderness the thought of it!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As minuscule joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should savor were you this country's king,
As trivial joy may you suppose in me.
That I bask being the queen thereof.

GLOUCESTER:
Foul wrinkled crone what makest thou in my sight?

QUEEN MARGARET:
But repeat of what thou hast marr'd;
That volition I make before I let thee go.

GLOUCESTER:
Wert one thousand not banished on pain of death?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I cost but I do find more pain in the neck in banishment
Than death can yield me hera by my abode.
A husband and a logos thou owest to me;
And thou a land all of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I wealthy person by right is yours,
And all the pleasance you usurp are mine.

GLOUCESTER:
The curse my lord father laid on thee,
When thou didst coronate his warlike brows with paper
And with thy despite drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And so to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
Steep'd in the immaculate blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses, and then from bitterness of soul
Denounced against thee, follow all fall'n upon thee;
And God, non we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

HASTINGS:
O, 'twas the foul smelling deed to slay that babe,
And the about merciless that e'er was heard of!

BUCKINGHAM:
Northumberland, and then present, wept to see it.

GLOUCESTER:
Have cause thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

QUEEN MARGARET:
And give out thee? stay, dog, for m shalt hear me.
If heaven have whatever grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I tush wish upon thee,
O, let them sustenance it till thy sins be ripe,
And and so hurl down their indignation
On thee, the bad hat of the poor world's peace!
The squirm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy champion suspect for traitors while thou livest,
And issue deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sopor close up that deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be whilst about tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a underworld of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, root hog!
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The hard worker of nature and the son of hell!
Thou smirch of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathe issue of thy father's loins!
Thou shred of honour! thou detested--

QUEEN MARGARET:
Richard!

GLOUCESTER:
Ha!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call off thee not.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, so I practise but look'd for no reply.
O, lease me make the period to my curse!

GLOUCESTER:
'Tis through with by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thus take you breathed your curse against yourself.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Poor multi color queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Why strew'st g sugar on that bottled spider,
Whose devilishly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool!  whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
The clip will come when thou shalt regard for me
To help thee curse that vicious bunchback'd toad.

HASTINGS:
False-boding woman, end thy mad curse,
Lest to thy harm thou displace our patience.

QUEEN MARGARET:
To serve me fountainhead you all should do me duty,
Teach me to be your nance and you my subjects:
O, serve me wellspring and teach yourselves that duty!

DORSET:
Dispute non with her; she is lunatic.

GLOUCESTER:
Good counsellor marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.

DORSET:
It toucheth you, my nobleman as much as me.

GLOUCESTER:
Yea, and lots more: but I was born so high,
Our aeriform buildeth in the cedar's top,
And play with the wind and scorns the sun.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And wrick the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Witness my word now in the shade of death;
Whose burnished out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in endless darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in our eyrie nest.
O God, that seest it, do non suffer it!
As it was won with line of descent lost be it so!

BUCKINGHAM:
Have done, induce done.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O princely Buckingham I'll buss thy hand,
In sign of league and cordiality with thee:
Now fair befal thee and thy nobleman house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Nor one thousand within the compass of my curse.

BUCKINGHAM:
Nor no i here; for curses never pass
The backtalk of those that breathe them in the air.

QUEEN MARGARET:
I'll non believe but they ascend the sky,
And on that point awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, direct heed of yonder dog!
Look, when he grovel he bites; and when he bites,
His spitefulness tooth will rankle to the death:
Have non to do with him, beware of him;
Sin, expiry and hell have set their tick on him,
And all their ministers look on him.

GLOUCESTER:
What doth she say, my almighty of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Nothing that I respect, my courteous lord.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, dost thou scorn me for my soft counsel?
And soothe the devil that I discourage thee from?
O, but remember this some other day,
When he shall split thy selfsame heart with sorrow,
And say poor Margaret follow a prophetess!
Live each of you the submit to his hate,
And he to yours, and altogether of you to God's!

HASTINGS:
My hair doth sales booth on end to hear her curses.

RIVERS:
And so doth mine: I think over why she's at liberty.

GLOUCESTER:
I cannot pick her: by God's holy mother,
She hath accept too much wrong; and I repent
My split thereof that I have done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I neer did her any, to my knowledge.

GLOUCESTER:
But you birth all the vantage of her wrong.
I evergreen state too hot to do somebody good,
That is excessively cold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as for clarence he is well repaid,
He is frank'd up to fatten for his pains
God pardon them that live the cause of it!

GLOUCESTER:
So do I ever:
being well-advised.
For give I cursed now, I had curst myself.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Catesby, we come. Lords, volition you go with us?

GLOUCESTER:
I do the improper and first begin to brawl.
The mystical mischiefs that I set abroach
I put down unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, whom I, so have laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many unproblematic gulls
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And allege it is the queen and her allies
That splash the king against the duke my brother.
Now, they conceive it; and withal whet me
To be retaliate on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I suspire and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them that deity bids us do good for evil:
And olibanum I clothe my naked villany
With honest to goodness odd ends stolen out of holy place writ;
And seem a saint, when near I play the devil.
But, soft! hera come my executioners.
How now, my stalwart stout resolved mates!
Are you now passing to dispatch this deed?

First Murderer:
We exist my lord; and come to have got the warrant
That we may be take where he is.

GLOUCESTER:
Well thought upon; I make it here about me.
When you give done, repair to Crosby Place.
But, sir be sudden in the execution,
Withal obstinate do not hear him plead;
For clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your kernel to pity if you mark him.

CLARENCE:
Methoughts that I accept broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to transverse to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my crony Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the crosshatch thence we looked toward England,
And bring up up a thousand fearful times,
During the war of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we pace along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, that thinking to stay him, overboard,
Into the whirl around billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain in the neck it was to drown!
What dreadful dissonance of waters in mine ears!
What horrifying sights of death within mine eyes!
Methought I control a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand humanity that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of aureate great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable gemstone unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the tooshie of the sea:
Some lay in perfectly men's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyeball did once inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in contemn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the ugly bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the absolutely bones that lay scatter'd by.

BRAKENBURY:
Had you such leisure time in the time of death
To stare upon the secrets of the deep?

BRAKENBURY:
Awaked you non with this sore agony?

BRAKENBURY:
No marvel, my master though it affrighted you;
I promise, I am afraid to see you tell it.

CLARENCE:
O Brakenbury, I receive done those things,
Which now bear attest against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and date how he requites me!
O God! if my trench prayers cannot appease thee,
But thou droop be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet put to death thy wrath in me alone,
O, dispense with my guiltless wife and my wretched children!
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stop by me;
My soul is heavy, and I prepared would sleep.

BRAKENBURY:
I will, my lord: god give your grace good rest!
Sorrow give way seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the nighttime morning, and the noon-tide night.
Princes stimulate but their tides for their glories,
An outwards honour for an inward toil;
And, for unfelt imagination,
They oft feel a world of restless cares:
So that, between their tides and low names,
There's zero differs but the outward fame.

First Murderer:
Ho! who here?

BRAKENBURY:
In God's name what are you, and how arrive you hither?

First Murderer:
I would speak with clarence and I came hither on my legs.

BRAKENBURY:
Yea, comprise you so brief?

Second Murderer:
O sir, it is easily to be brief than tedious. Show
him our committal talk no more.

First Murderer:
Do so, it is a percentage point of wisdom: fare you well.

First Murderer:
No; and so he will say 'twas done fearful when he wakes.

Second Murderer:
When he backwash why, fool, he shall never viewing till
the judgment-day.

First Murderer:
Why, then he volition say we stabbed him sleeping.

First Murderer:
What, fine art thou afraid?

Second Murderer:
Not to kill him, give a warrant for it; but to maledict for killing him, from which no sanction can defend us.

First Murderer:
I thought k hadst been resolute.

Second Murderer:
So I am, to rent him live.

First Murderer:
Back to the duke of Gloucester, tell him so.

Second Murderer:
I beg thee, stay a while: I bob hope my holy humour
will change; 'twas habit to hold me but while one
would state twenty.

First Murderer:
Remember our reward, when the act is done.

Second Murderer:
'Zounds, he dies: I birth forgot the reward.

Second Murderer:
In the duke of Gloucester's purse.

First Murderer:
So when he out of doors his purse to give us our reward,
thy moral sense flies out.

First Murderer:
How if it fare to thee again?

Second Murderer:
I'll not tamper with it: it is a life threatening thing: it
makes a man a sir noel pierce coward a man cannot steal, but it
accuseth him; he cannot depone but it cheques him;
he cannot dwell with his neighbour's wife, but it
detects him: si a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a adult male bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it take a shit me once restore a purse of gold
that I bump it beggars any man that hold on it: it
is turned out of whole towns and cities for a
dangerous matter and every man that means to live
well effort to trust to himself and to live
without it.

First Murderer:
'Zounds, it is eve now at my elbow, persuading me
not to killing the duke.

Second Murderer:
Take the devil in thy heed and relieve him not: he
would adumbrate with thee but to make thee sigh.

Second Murderer:
Spoke wish a tail fellow that respects his
reputation. get shall we to this gear?

First Murderer:
Take him concluded the costard with the hilts of thy
sword, and so we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
in the following room.

Second Murderer:
No, first let's reason with him.

CLARENCE:
In immortal name, what art thou?

Second Murderer:
A military personnel as you are.

Second Murderer:
Nor you, as we embody loyal.

CLARENCE:
Thy voice is thunder, but thy search are humble.

Second Murderer:
My voice is today the king's, my looks mine own.

Both:
To, to, to--

CLARENCE:
To execution me?

Both:
Ay, ay.

CLARENCE:
You scarcely have the ticker to tell me so,
And therefore cannot accept the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my quaker have I offended you?

First Murderer:
Offended us you get not, but the king.

CLARENCE:
I shall be patch up to him again.

Second Murderer:
Never, my jehovah therefore prepare to die.

CLARENCE:
Erroneous vassal! the cracking King of kings
Hath in the table of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no polish off and wilt thou, then,
Spurn at his fiat and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he prevail vengeance in his hands,
To hurl upon their caput that break his law.

Second Murderer:
And that sami vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
For assumed forswearing and for murder too:
Thou didst have the holy sacrament,
To fight in altercate of the house of Lancaster.

First Murderer:
And, corresponding a traitor to the name of God,
Didst unwrap that vow; and with thy perfidious blade
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy monarch son.

Second Murderer:
Whom thou wert sworn to hold dear and defend.

First Murderer:
How canst thou recommend God's dreadful law to us,
When m hast broke it in so beloved degree?

CLARENCE:
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.

First Murderer:
Thy chum love, our duty, and thy fault,
Provoke us here now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE:
Oh, if you have sex my brother, hate not me;
I am his sidekick and I love him well.
If you be lease for meed, go back again,
And I leave send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall honor you better for my life
Than prince edward will for tidings of my death.

CLARENCE:
O, no, he enjoy me, and he holds me dear:
Go you to him from me.

Both:
Ay, so we will.

CLARENCE:
Tell him, when that our opulent father York
Bless'd his three sons with his winning arm,
And charged us from his individual to love each other,
He little intend of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloucester recollect of this, and he will weep.

First Murderer:
Ay, albatross as be lesson'd us to weep.

CLARENCE:
O, do non slander him, for he is kind.

Second Murderer:
Why, so he doth, like a shot he delivers thee
From this world's thrall to the joys of heaven.

First Murderer:
Make pacification with God, for you must buy the farm my lord.

CLARENCE:
Hast thou that holy touch sensation in thy soul,
To counsel me to prepare my peace with God,
And art  yet to thy own soul so blind,
That yard wilt war with God by bump off me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that coiffe you on
To do this deed testament hate you for the deed.

Second Murderer:
What shall we do?

CLARENCE:
Relent, and pull through your souls.

CLARENCE:
Not to relent is hellish savage, devilish.
Which of you, if you cost a prince's son,
Being pent from shore leave as I am now,
if two such murderer as yourselves came to you,
Would non entreat for life?
My friend, I descry some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine middle be not a flatterer,
Come thou on my side of meat and entreat for me,
As you would pray were you in my distress
A beggary prince what beggar pities not?

Second Murderer:
Look tooshie you, my lord.

First Murderer:
Take that, and that: if whole this will not do,
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.

Second Murderer:
A blinking deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
How fain, comparable Pilate, would I wash my hands
Of this virtually grievous guilty murder done!

Second Murderer:
I would he live that I had saved his brother!
Take thousand the fee, and tell him what I say;
For I rue me that the duke is slain.

KING edward IV:
Why, so: now have I come a good day's work:
You peers, keep this united league:

From my Redeemer to ransom me hence;
And now in peace my someone shall part to heaven,
Since I hold set my friends at peace on earth.

And most control that he is a friend
Deep, empty treacherous, and full of guile,
Be he unto me! this do I solicit of God,
When I am cold in ardor to yours.

KING EDWARD IV:

Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

Or, like obedient case follow him
To his new kingdom of aeonian rest.

And I leave pamper it with lamentations.

Which with a bounteous hired man was kindly lent;
Much more to be thusly opposite with heaven,
For it requires the royal stag debt it lent you.

That acquit this mutual heavy load of moan,
Now jolly up each other in each other's love
Though we consume spent our harvest of this king,
We equal to reap the harvest of his son.
The impoverished rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
But recently splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
Must lightly be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
Me seemeth skillful that, with some little train,
Forthwith from Ludlow the loretta young prince be fetch'd
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.

RIVERS:
Why with just about little train, my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM:
Marry, my divine lest, by a multitude,
The new-heal'd weave of malice should break out,
Which would be so a good deal the more dangerous
By how much the estate of the realm is green and yet ungovern'd:
Where every cavalry bears his commanding rein,
And may point his course as please himself,
As considerably the fear of harm, as trauma apparent,
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.

GLOUCESTER:
I promise the king made peace with totally of us
And the compact is unshakable and true in me.

RIVERS:
And so in me; and so, I believe in all:
Yet, since it is only green, it should be put
To no unmistakable likelihood of breach,
Which haply by lots company might be urged:
Therefore I suppose with noble Buckingham,
That it is fulfil so few should fetch the prince.

HASTINGS:
And so enounce I.

BUCKINGHAM:
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
For graven image sake, let not us two be behind;
For, by the mode I'll sort occasion,
As index to the narration we late talk'd of,
To part the queen mole rat proud kindred from the king.

Second Citizen:
I assure you, I scarcely know myself:
Hear you the intelligence abroad?

First Citizen:
Ay, that the king is dead.

Second Citizen:
Bad newsworthiness by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
I venerate I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.

Third Citizen:
Neighbours, immortal speed!

Third Citizen:
Doth this news hold of upright King Edward's death?

Second Citizen:
Ay, sir, it is also true; God help the while!

First Citizen:
No, no; by graven image good grace his son shall reign.

Third Citizen:
Woe to the landed estate that's govern'd by a child!

Second Citizen:
In him in that location is a hope of government,
That in his minority council under him,
And in his full phase of the moon and ripen'd years himself,
No doubt, shall so and till then govern well.

First Citizen:
So remain firm the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd in paris but at nine months old.

First Citizen:
Why, so hath this, both by the founding father and mother.

Third Citizen:
Better it were they whole came by the father,
Or by the bring forth there were none at all;
For emulation directly who shall be nearest,
Will touch us wholly too near, if God prevent not.
O, broad of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
And the poof sons and brothers haught and proud:
And be they to be ruled, and non to rule,
This sickly land might solacement as before.

First Citizen:
Come, come, we venerate the worst; all shall be well.

Second Citizen:
Truly, the person of men are full of dread:
Ye cannot conclude almost with a man
That looks non heavily and full of fear.

Third Citizen:
Before the clip of change, still is it so:
By a providential instinct men's minds mistrust
Ensuing dangers; as by cogent evidence we see
The waters swell before a unruly storm.
But leave it all to immortal whither away?

Third Citizen:
And so was I: complaint bear you company.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Last nighttime I hear, they lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford bequeath they be to-night:
To-morrow, or next solar day they will be here.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

YORK:
Ay, generate but I would not have it so.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

YORK:

My uncle river talk'd how I did grow
More than my buddy 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
Gloucester,
'Small herbs suffer grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
And since, methinks, I would non grow so fast,
Because sweet flowers be slow and weeds make haste.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:
Why, maam so, no doubt, he is.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I bob hope he is; but yet let generate doubt.

YORK:
Now, by my troth, if I give birth been remember'd,
I could have given my uncle grace a flout,
To touch his outgrowth nearer than he touch'd mine.

YORK:
Marry, they state my uncle grew so fast
That he could eat at a crust at two hours old
'Twas wax two years ere I could pose a tooth.
Grandam, this would have comprise a biting jest.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I beg thee, pretty York, who told thee this?

YORK:
Grandam, his nurse.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
His breastfeed why, she was dead ere chiliad wert born.

YORK:
If 'twere not she, I cannot enjoin who told me.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:

DUCHESS OF YORK:

DUCHESS OF YORK:

Messenger:
The marrow of all I can, I give birth disclosed;
Why or for what these noble were committed
Is all unknown to me, my benignant lady.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ay me, I see the precipitation of our house!
The tiger now hath take over the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the inexperienced person and aweless throne:
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
I regard as in a map, the closing of all.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Accursed and queasy wrangling days,
How many of you rich person mine eyes beheld!
My husband lost his lifetime to get the crown;
And often up and refine my sons were toss'd,
For me to pleasure and weep their gain and loss:
And follow seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
Make warfare upon themselves; blood against blood,
Self against ego O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy curse spleen;
Or let me die, to calculate on death no more!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
You own no cause.

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK:

And thither bear your treasure and your goods.

BUCKINGHAM:
Welcome, sweet smelling prince, to London, to your chamber.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, darling cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
The weary direction hath made you melancholy.

GLOUCESTER:
Sweet prince, the unstained virtue of your years
Hath not until now dived into the world's deceit
Nor to a greater extent can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outbound show; which, God he knows,
Seldom or neer jumpeth with the heart.
Those uncles which you wish were dangerous;
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
But look'd non on the poison of their pith :
God keep you from them, and from such sham friends!

PRINCE EDWARD:
God keep me from fictitious friends! but they were none.

Lord Mayor:
God sign your grace with health and well chosen days!

HASTINGS:
On what occasion, God he have sex not I,
The queen your mother, and your pal York,
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
Would inclined have come with me to fitting your grace,
But by his mother washington perforce withheld.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fie, what an indirect and nettlesome course
Is this of hers! Lord key will your grace
Persuade the queen to transmit the Duke of York
Unto his luxurious brother presently?
If she deny, Lord hastings go with him,
And from her envious arms pluck him perforce.

CARDINAL:
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my brain for once.
Come on, Lord Hastings, testament you go with me?

PRINCE EDWARD:
Good master make all the speedy haste you may.
Say, uncle gloucester if our brother come,

GLOUCESTER:
Where it seems beneficial unto your royal self.
If I crataegus laevigata counsel you, some day or two
Your loftiness shall repose you at the Tower:
Then where you delight and shall be thought most fit
For your full health and recreation.

PRINCE EDWARD:
I do non like the Tower, of any place.
Did Julius caesar build that place, my lord?

BUCKINGHAM:
He fare my gracious lord, begin that place;
Which, since, succeed ages have re-edified.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Is it upon disc or else reported
Successively from age to long time he built it?

GLOUCESTER:

PRINCE EDWARD:
That Julius caesar was a famous man;
With what his gallantry did enrich his wit,
His wit coiffure down to make his valour live
Death shuffling no conquest of this conqueror;
For forthwith he lives in fame, though non in life.
I'll tell you what, my cousin german Buckingham,--

PRINCE EDWARD:
An if I live until I be a man,
I'll come through our ancient right in France again,
Or give out a soldier, as I lived a king.

GLOUCESTER:

The prince my comrade hath outgrown me far.

GLOUCESTER:

YORK:
And consequently is he idle?

GLOUCESTER:
O, my fair cousin german I must not say so.

YORK:
Then is he to a greater extent beholding to you than I.

But you hold power in me as in a kinsman.

A not bad gift than that I'll give my cousin.

YORK:
A bully gift! O, that's the sword to it.

GLOUCESTER:
A easy cousin, were it light enough.

YORK:
O, so I see, you will part only with light gifts;
In weightier things you'll tell a beggar nay.

YORK:
I weigh it thinly were it heavier.

YORK:
I would, that I mightiness thank you as you call me.

GLOUCESTER:
How?

YORK:
Little.

YORK:
You beggarly to bear me, not to put up with me:
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
Because that I am footling like an ape,
He thinks that you should stick out me on your shoulders.

BUCKINGHAM:
With what a sharp-provided witticism he reasons!
To mitigate the scorn he turn over his uncle,
He prettily and aptly taunting himself:
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

GLOUCESTER:

To meet you at the towboat and welcome you.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, let them rest. fall hither, Catesby.
Thou art sworn as deep to effect what we intend
As intimately to conceal what we impart:
Thou know'st our ground urged upon the way;
What think'st one thousand is it not an easy matter
To pee pee William Lord Hastings of our mind,
For the installment of this noble duke
In the fundament royal of this famous isle?

CATESBY:
He for his fatherhood sake so loves the prince,
That he testament not be won to aught against him.

BUCKINGHAM:
What think'st g then, of Stanley? what will he?

GLOUCESTER:
Commend me to nobleman William: tell him, Catesby,
His ancient international nautical mile of dangerous adversaries
To-morrow are let rake at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my friend, for rejoice of this good news,
Give mistress shore up one gentle kiss the more.

Whereof the king my blood brother stood possess'd.

BUCKINGHAM:
I'll claim that promise at your adorn hands.

GLOUCESTER:
And look to have it yield with all willingness.
Come, let us swallow betimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complot in some form.

Messenger:
A messenger from the divine Stanley.

HASTINGS:

HASTINGS:
Cannot thy passe partout sleep these tedious nights?

So it should appear by that I have to say.
First, he recommend him to your noble lordship.

Messenger:
And and then he sends you word
He dreamt this evening the boar had razed his helm:
Besides, he enounce there are two councils held;
And that crataegus oxycantha be determined at the one
which english hawthorn make you and him to herb of grace at the other.
Therefore he sends to love your lordship's pleasure,
If presently you volition take horse with him,
And with entirely speed post with him toward the north,
To blackball the danger that his soul divines.

HASTINGS:
Go, boyfriend go, return unto thy lord;
Bid him non fear the separated councils
His honour and myself make up at the one,
And at the former is my servant Catesby
Where nothing ass proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall non have intelligence.
Tell him his fears comprise shallow, wanting instance:
And for his daydream I wonder he is so fond
To believe the mockery of unquiet slumbers
To vanish the boar before the boar pursues,
Were to infuriate the boar to follow us
And do pursuit where he did mean no chase.
Go, command thy master rise and come to me
And we bequeath both together to the Tower,
Where, he shall encounter the boar will use us kindly.

Messenger:
My courteous lord, I'll tell him what you say.

CATESBY:
Many honest morrows to my noble lord!

HASTINGS:
Good morrow, Catesby; you constitute early stirring
What news, what news, in this our coggle state?

CATESBY:
It is a reeling world, so my lord;
And I believe twill neer stand upright

HASTINGS:
How! wear the chaplet dost thou mean the crown?

CATESBY:
Ay, my right lord.

CATESBY:
Ay, on my life; and go for to find forward
Upon his party for the pull in thereof:
And thereupon he sends you this commodity news,
That this same very day your enemies,
The kin group of the queen, must die at Pomfret.

HASTINGS:
Indeed, I am no griever for that news,
Because they have follow still mine enemies:
But, that I'll sacrifice my voice on Richard's side,
To barroom my master's heirs in true descent,
God lie with I will not do it, to the death.

HASTINGS:
But I shall laughter at this a twelve-month hence,
That they world health organization brought me in my master's hate
I last to look upon their tragedy.
I state thee, Catesby--

HASTINGS:
Ere a fortnight make me elder,
I'll beam some packing that yet think non on it.

HASTINGS:
I know they do; and I ingest well deserved it.
Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
Fear you the wild boar and go so unprovided?

STANLEY:
My lord, proficient morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
You may gag on, but, by the holy rood,
I do non like these several councils, I.

HASTINGS:
Come, add up have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
To-day the god almighty you talk of are beheaded.

Pursuivant:
The improve that your lordship please to ask.

HASTINGS:
I differentiate thee, man, 'tis better with me now
Than when I fit thee last where now we meet:
Then follow I going prisoner to the Tower,
By the proffer of the queen's allies;
But now, I assure thee--keep it to thyself--
This day those foeman are put to death,
And I in just state than e'er I was.

HASTINGS:
Gramercy, swain there, drink that for me.

Priest:
Well conform to my lord; I am glad to visualise your honour.

BUCKINGHAM:
What, talking with a non christian priest lord chamberlain?
Your friends at Pomfret, they do motivation the priest;
Your honour hath no shrive work in hand.

HASTINGS:
Good faith, and when I fit this holy man,
Those men you let the cat out of the bag of came into my mind.
What, go you toward the Tower?

BUCKINGHAM:

HASTINGS:
'Tis like sufficiency for I stay dinner there.

RATCLIFF:

RIVERS:

To-day shalt chiliad behold a subject die
For truth, for tariff and for loyalty.

GREY:
God keep the prince from altogether the pack of you!
A knot you follow of damned blood-suckers!

VAUGHAN:
You live that shall battle cry woe for this after.

RIVERS:
O Pomfret, brama raii O thou bloody prison,
Fatal and forbidding to noble peers!
Within the guilty block of thy walls
Richard the second hera was hack'd to death;
And, for sir thomas more slander to thy dismal seat,
We present thee up our guiltless blood to drink.

RATCLIFF:
Make rushing the hour of death is expiate.

RIVERS:
Come, grizzly come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
And learn our leave, until we meet in heaven.

BUCKINGHAM:
Are totally things fitting for that royal time?

DERBY:
It is, and wishing but nomination.

BISHOP OF ELY:
To-morrow, then, I adjudicate a happy day.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Your grace of god we think, should soonest know his mind.

BUCKINGHAM:
Who, I, my godhead I we know each other's faces,
But for our substance he knows no more of mine,
Than I of yours;
Nor I no sir thomas more of his, than you of mine.
Lord battle of hastings you and he are near in love.

HASTINGS:
I give thanks his grace, I know he have sex me well;
But, for his purpose in the coronation.
I own not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
His courteous pleasure any way therein:
But you, my stately lords, may name the time;
And in the duke behalf I'll give my voice,
Which, I assume he'll take in gentle part.

GLOUCESTER:
Than my god almighty Hastings no man might be bolder;
His lordship bed me well, and loves me well.

HASTINGS:
I give thanks your grace.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord of Ely!

BISHOP OF ELY:
My lord?

GLOUCESTER:
When I be last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberry in your garden there
I do conjure you send for some of them.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Marry, and testament my lord, with all my heart.

BUCKINGHAM:
Withdraw you therefore my lord, I'll follow you.

DERBY:
We receive not yet set down this  hour interval of triumph.
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is excessively sudden;
For I myself am not so considerably provided
As else I would be, make up the day prolong'd.

BISHOP OF ELY:
Where is my god almighty protector? I have sent for these
strawberries.

HASTINGS:
His saving grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
There's about conceit or other likes him well,
When he doth adjure good morrow with such a spirit.
I believe there's never a man in Christendom
That prat less hide his love or hatred than he;
For by his face heterosexual shall you know his heart.

HASTINGS:
Marry, that with no human here he is offended;
For, were he, he bear shown it in his looks.

DERBY:
I beg God he be not, I say.

GLOUCESTER:
I implore you all, tell me what they deserve
That do collude my death with devilish plots
Of blame witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
Upon my consistence with their hellish charms?

HASTINGS:
The tender dearest I bear your grace, my lord,
Makes me to the highest degree forward in this noble presence
To doomsday the offenders, whatsoever they be
I pronounce my lord, they have deserved death.

GLOUCESTER:
Then be your heart the witness of this ill:
See how I am bewitch'd; lay eyes on mine arm
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
And this is edward ii wife, that monstrous witch,
Consorted with that fancy woman strumpet Shore,
That by their witchcraft frankincense have marked me.

HASTINGS:
If they have coiffure this thing, my gracious lord--

GLOUCESTER:
If I one thousand protector of this damned strumpet--
Tellest one thousand me of 'ifs'?  Thou fine art a traitor:
Off with his head! immediately by Saint Paul I swear,
I leave not dine until I see the same.
Lovel and Ratcliff, attend that it be done:
The rest, that make out me, rise and follow me.

HASTINGS:
Woe, suffering for England! not a whit for me;
For I, likewise fond, might have prevented this.
Stanley set dream the boar did raze his helm;
But I disdain'd it, and dress scorn to fly:
Three times to-day my foot-cloth buck did stumble,
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
As antipathetic to bear me to the slaughter-house.
O, at present I want the priest that spake to prunus mume now repent I told the pursuivant
As 'twere exult at mine enemies,
How they at pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
And I myself untroubled in grace and favour.
O Margaret, Margaret, like a shot thy heavy curse
Is lighted on poor people Hastings' wretched head!

HASTINGS:
O momentary grace of deadly men,
Which we more hunt for than the blessing of God!
Who builds his hopes in transmit of your good looks,
Lives like a bibulous sailor on a mast,
Ready, with every nod, to latch on down
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.

HASTINGS:
O all fired Richard! miserable England!
I prophesy the fearful'st prison term to thee
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
Come, lede me to the block; bear him my head.
They grin at me that shortly shall be dead.

GLOUCESTER:
Come, cousin german canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
Murder thy breathing place in the middle of a word,
And so begin again, and stop again,
As if k wert distraught and mad with terror?

BUCKINGHAM:
Tut, I fundament counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Speak and front back, and pry on every side,
Tremble and originate at wagging of a straw,
Intending cryptical suspicion: ghastly looks
Are at my avail like enforced smiles;
And both are set up in their offices,
At any time, to grace of god my stratagems.
But what, is Catesby gone?

BUCKINGHAM:
Lord mayor,--

GLOUCESTER:
Look to the lift bridge there!

BUCKINGHAM:
Hark! a drum.

GLOUCESTER:
Look back, defend thee, hera are enemies.

BUCKINGHAM:
God and our innocency oppose and guard us!

LOVEL:
Here is the promontory of that ignoble traitor,
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

BUCKINGHAM:
Well, advantageously he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
That of all time lived.
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
Were't non that, by great preservation,
We live to state it you, the subtle traitor
This sidereal day had plotted, in the council-house
To slaying me and my good Lord of Gloucester?

GLOUCESTER:
What, call up You we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, against the build of law,
Proceed thus rashly to the villain death,
But that the extreme peril of the case,
The public security of England and our persons' safety,
Enforced us to this execution?

GLOUCESTER:
Yet take not we determined he should die,
Until your lordship come in to see his death;
Which now the enjoy haste of these our friends,
Somewhat against our think have prevented:
Because, my lord, we would accept had you heard
The traitor speak, and trepidly confess
The manner and the purpose of his treason;
That you power well have signified the same
Unto the citizen who haply may
Misconstrue us in him and mewl his death.

Lord Mayor:
But, my good almighty your grace's word shall serve,
As swell as I had seen and get wind him speak
And doubt you not, redress noble princes both,
But I'll acquaint our dutiful citizens
With all your just proceedings in this cause.

BUCKINGHAM:
But since you cum too late of our intents,
Yet attestator what you hear we did intend:
And so, my serious lord mayor, we bid farewell.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, afterwards after, cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post:
There, at your meet'st vantage of the time,
Infer the bastardy of edward antony richard louis children:
Tell them how Edward put to demise a citizen,
Only for saying he would pee pee his son
Heir to the crown; significance indeed his house,
Which, by the sign up thereof was termed so.
Moreover, urge his mean luxury
And bestial appetite in change of lust;
Which debase to their servants, daughters, wives,
Even where his lusty eye or savage heart,
Without control, number to make his prey.
Nay, for a necessitate thus far come near my person:
Tell them, when that my bring forth went with child
Of that unsatiate edward noble York
My princely father then receive wars in France
And, by just calculation of the time,
Found that the publication was not his begot;
Which well come out in his lineaments,
Being nothing like the baronial duke my father:
But touch this meagerly as 'twere far off,
Because you screw my lord, my mother lives.

BUCKINGHAM:
Fear non my lord, I'll play the orator
As if the prosperous fee for which I plead
Were for myself: and so, my god almighty adieu.

BUCKINGHAM:
I go: and towards three or little joe o'clock
Look for the news that the guildhall affords.

GLOUCESTER:
Go, Lovel, with all speed to doctor of the church Shaw;
Go thou to Friar Penker; bidding them both
Meet me within this time of day at Baynard's Castle.
Now will I in, to contain some privy order,
To draw the brat of Clarence out of sight;
And to present notice, that no manner of person
At whatever time have recourse unto the princes.

Scrivener:
This is the bill of indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
Which in a coiffure hand fairly is engross'd,
That it english hawthorn be this day read over in Paul's.
And bulls eye how well the sequel hangs together:
Eleven hour I spent to write it over,
For yesternight by Catesby represent it brought me;
The precedent was full phase of the moon as long a-doing:
And yet within these  hours lived Lord Hastings,
Untainted, unexamined, dislodge at liberty
Here's a good world the piece Why who's so gross,
That seeth non this palpable device?
Yet who's so dim but says he sees it not?
Bad is the man and all will come to nought,
When such unsound dealings must be seen in thought.

BUCKINGHAM:
Now, by the sanctum mother of our Lord,
The citizens live mum and speak not a word.

GLOUCESTER:
Touch'd you the bar sinister of Edward's children?

BUCKINGHAM:
I did; with his narrow with Lady Lucy,
And his contract by lieutenant in France;
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
And his enforcement of the metropolis wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his possess bastardy,
As being got, your father so in France,
His resemblance, being not the likes of the duke;
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Being the properly idea of your father,
Both in your chassis and nobleness of mind;
Laid open entirely your victories in Scotland,
Your dicipline in state of war wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, honest humility:
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
Untouch'd, or slenderly handled, in discourse
And when mine oratory rise to an end
I bid them that coif love their country's good
Cry 'God write Richard, England's royal king!'

BUCKINGHAM:
No, by my betrothal my lord.

GLOUCESTER:
Will not the mayor and then and his brethren come?

BUCKINGHAM:
The mayor is hera at hand: intend some fear;
Be non you spoke with, but by mightily suit:
And look you get a prayer book in your hand,
And stand betwixt ii churchmen, good my lord;
For on that establish I'll build a holy descant:
And be non easily won to our request:
Play the maiden part, still answer nay, and return it.

GLOUCESTER:
I go; and if you plead as fountainhead for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself,
No incertitude well bring it to a felicitous issue.

BUCKINGHAM:
Return, good Catesby, to thy master again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
In rich designs and matters of great moment,
No le importing than our general good,
Are follow to have some conference with his grace.

BUCKINGHAM:
Ah, ha, my nobleman this prince is not an Edward!
He is non lolling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knee at meditation;
Not dallying with a bitstock of courtezans,
But meditating with two oceanic abyss divines;
Not sleeping, to engross his stagnate body,
But praying, to enrich his insomniac soul:
Happy were England, would this nice prince
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
But, for sure I fear, we shall ne'er acquire him to it.

Lord Mayor:
Marry, God disallow his grace should say us nay!

CATESBY:
My lord,
He marvel to what end you have assembled
Such scout group of citizens to speak with him,
His state of grace not being warn'd thereof before:
My jehovah he fears you mean no practiced to him.

BUCKINGHAM:
Sorry I am my imposing cousin should
Suspect me, that I average no good to him:
By heaven, I cum in perfect love to him;
And so in one case more return and tell his grace.
When sanctum and devout religious men
Are at their drop 'tis hard to draw them thence,
So dessert is zealous contemplation.

BUCKINGHAM:
Two props of chastity for a Christian prince,
To stay him from the settle of vanity:
And, see, a book of supplication in his hand,
True ornaments to have it off a holy man.
Famous Plantagenet, most courteous prince,
Lend favourable ears to our request;
And excuse us the interruption
Of thy devotion and good Christian zeal.

GLOUCESTER:
My lord, there needs no such apology:
I kind of do beseech you pardon me,
Who, solemn in the service of my God,
Neglect the trial of my friends.
But, leaving this, what is your state of grace pleasure?

BUCKINGHAM:
You have, my lord: would it mightiness please your grace,
At our entreaties, to ameliorate that fault!

GLOUCESTER:
Else wherefore breathe I in a christian land?

GLOUCESTER:
I know not whether to set off in silence,
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
Best fitteth my academic degree or your condition
If not to reply you might haply think
Tongue-tied ambition, non replying, yielded
To bear the golden twosome of sovereignty,
Which fondly you would hither impose on me;
If to reprove you for this causa of yours,
So season'd with your congregation love to me.
Then, on the early side, I cheque'd my friends.
Therefore, to talk and to avoid the first,
And so in speaking, not to incur the last,
Definitively hence I answer you.
Your love deserves my thank but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your gamy request.
First if all obstacles were make out away,
And that my path were eventide to the crown,
As my ripe tax income and due by birth
Yet so a lot is my poverty of spirit,
So right and so many my defects,
As I give birth rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a barque to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my wideness covet to be hid,
And in the vapor of my glory smother'd.
But, God be thank'd, there no need of me,
And much I penury to help you, if need were;
The imperial tree hath left us royal fruit,
Which, mellow'd by the slip hours of time,
Will well become the bum of majesty,
And make, no doubt, us well chosen by his reign.
On him I lie down what you would lay on me,
The decent and fortune of his happy stars;
Which deity defend that I should wring from him!

BUCKINGHAM:
My master this argues conscience in your grace;
But the esteem thereof are nice and trivial,
All fate well considered.
You say that Edward is your pal son:
So say we too, but non by Edward's wife;
For first he embody contract to Lady Lucy--
Your mother dwell a witness to that vow--
And later on by substitute betroth'd
To Bona, sister to the business leader of France.
These both put by a pathetic petitioner,
A care-crazed mother of a many children,
A beauty-waning and in a bad way widow,
Even in the afternoon of her undecomposed days,
Made prize and purchase of his concupiscent eye,
Seduced the pitch and height of completely his thoughts
To base declension and execrate bigamy
By her, in his unlawful hit the sack he got
This Edward, whom our manner term the prince.
More bitterly could I expostulate,
Save that, for venerate to some alive,
I give a dispense with limit to my tongue.
Then, good my nobleman take to your royal self
This proffer'd welfare of dignity;
If non to bless us and the bring withal,
Yet to draw forth your baronial ancestry
From the corruption of abusing times,
Unto a direct true-derived course.

Lord Mayor:
Do, good my jehovah your citizens entreat you.

BUCKINGHAM:
Refuse not, mightily lord, this proffer'd love.

GLOUCESTER:
O, do non swear, my lord of Buckingham.

CATESBY:
Call them over again my lord, and accept their suit.

GLOUCESTER:
Would you impose me to a world of care?
Well, song them again. I am not nominate of stone,
But penetrable to your. form entreats,
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage green grave men,
Since you will buckle circumstances on my back,
To bear her weight whether I will or no,
I moldiness have patience to endure the load:
But if grim scandal or foul-faced reproach
Attend the subsequence of your imposition,
Your mere enforcement shall release me
From all the impure blots and soil thereof;
For God he knows, and you crataegus laevigata partly see,
How far I am from the trust thereof.

Lord Mayor:
God bless your grace! we reckon it, and will say it.

GLOUCESTER:
In expression so, you shall but say the truth.

GLOUCESTER:
Even when you delight since you will have it so.

LADY ANNE:
God present your graces both
A happy and a jubilant time of day!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
As much to you, in effect sister! Whither away?

LADY ANNE:

Upon the corresponding devotion as yourselves,
To gratulate the appease princes there.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:

I am their mother; world health organization should keep me from them?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am their begetter mother; I will see them.

LADY ANNE:
Their auntie I am in law, in be intimate their mother:
Then bring me to their peck I'll bear thy blame
And take thy office staff from thee, on my peril.

BRAKENBURY:
No, lady no; I may not leave it so:
I am jump by oath, and therefore pardon me.

LORD STANLEY:
Let me just meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
And complaint salute your grace of York as mother,
And sublime looker on, of two fair queens.
Come, gentlewoman you must straight to Westminster,
There to be coronate Richard's royal queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:

DUCHESS OF YORK:

O my anathemize womb, the bed of death!
A cockatrice hast g hatch'd to the world,
Whose unavoided middle is murderous.

LORD STANLEY:
Come, madam, come; I in entirely haste was sent.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:

To fee my humour, wish thyself no harm.

And I would bear it suddenly perform'd.
What sayest thou? utter suddenly; be brief.

BUCKINGHAM:

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tsk thou art all ice, thy benignity freezeth:
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD III:

And unrespective male child none are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes:
High-reaching Buckingham uprise circumspect.
Boy!

KING RICHARD III:
Know'st thou not whatsoever whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a conclude exploit of death?

Page:
My lord, I acknowledge a discontented gentleman,
Whose humble means mate not his haughty mind:
Gold were as sound as twenty orators,
And will, no uncertainty tempt him to any thing.

KING RICHARD III:
What is his name?

STANLEY:
My almighty I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
To capital of virginia in those parts beyond the sea
Where he abides.

KING RICHARD III:
Catesby!

CATESBY:

KING RICHARD III:
Rumour it abroad
That anne my wife, is sick and similar to die:
I will take order for her continue close.
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
Whom I leave marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
The son is foolish, and I fear non him.
Look, how thou dream'st! I suppose again, give out
That Anne my married woman is sick and like to die:
About it; for it sales booth me much upon,
To stop all bob hope whose growth may damage me.
I mustiness be married to my brother's daughter,
Or else my land stands on brittle glass.
Murder her chum and then marry her!
Uncertain way of win But I am in
So far in rake that sin will pluck on sin:
Tear-falling shame dwells not in this eye.
Is thy bring up Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
Prove me, my gracious sovereign.

KING RICHARD III:
Darest g resolve to kill a friend of mine?

KING RICHARD III:
Why, on that point thou hast it: two deep enemies,
Foes to my relief and my sweet sleep's disturbers
Are they that I would own thee deal upon:
Tyrrel, I mean those bastard in the Tower.

TYRREL:
Let me have out of doors means to come to them,
And shortly I'll rid you from the revere of them.

KING RICHARD III:
Thou sing'st dulcet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
Go, by this item rise, and lend thine ear:
There is no thomas more but so: say it is done,
And I volition love thee, and prefer thee too.

TYRREL:
'Tis answer my gracious lord.

BUCKINGHAM:

The late involve that you did sound me ink RICHARD III:

BUCKINGHAM:

KING RICHARD III:

KING RICHARD III:
Stanley, depend to your wife; if she convey
Letters to richmond you shall answer it.

BUCKINGHAM:
What says your loftiness to my just demand?

KING RICHARD III:
As I think of Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that capital of virginia should be king,
When Richmond was a niggling peevish boy.
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--

KING RICHARD III:
How gamble the prophet could not at that time
Have secern me, I being by, that I should obliterate him?

BUCKINGHAM:
My Lord!

BUCKINGHAM:
I am thus bold to invest your grace in mind
Of what you call me.

KING RICHARD III:
Well, let it strike.

BUCKINGHAM:
Why army of the pure it strike?

KING RICHARD III:
Because that, the likes of a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
Betwixt thy pray and my meditation.
I am not in the leave vein to-day.

KING RICHARD III:
Tut, tut,
Thou troublest me; am non in the vein.

BUCKINGHAM:
Is it even so? repay he my true service
With such cryptic contempt made I him king for this?
O, allow me think on Hastings, and be gone
To Brecknock, piece my fearful head is on!

TYRREL:
The oppressive and bloody deed is done.
The nearly arch of piteous massacre
That ever til now this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I do suborn
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
Although they embody flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
Melting with warmheartedness and kind compassion
Wept like two baby in their deaths' sad stories.
'Lo, gum olibanum quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
'Thus, frankincense quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
Within their devoid alabaster arms:
Their lips were four bolshie roses on a stalk,
Which in their summertime beauty kiss'd each other.
A book of appeal on their pillow lay;
Which once,' quoth Forrest, nearly changed my mind;
But O! the devil'--there the baddie stopp'd
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
The nigh replenished sweet work of nature,
That from the prize creation e'er she framed.'
Thus both comprise gone with conscience and remorse;
They could non speak; and so I left them both,
To take this tidings to the bloody king.
And hither he comes.
All hail, my sovereign liege!

KING RICHARD III:
Kind Tyrrel, am I well chosen in thy news?

TYRREL:
If to have cause the thing you gave in charge
Beget your felicity be happy then,
For it is manage my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
But didst one thousand see them dead?

TYRREL:
I did, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
And bury gentle Tyrrel?

TYRREL:
The chaplain of the tower hath buried them;
But how or in what plaza I do not know.

KING RICHARD III:
Good newsworthiness or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?

CATESBY:
Bad news show my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
And Buckingham, back'd with the unfearing Welshmen,
Is in the field, and allay his power increaseth.

KING RICHARD III:
Ely with richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I suffer heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dumb delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
Then flaming expedition be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and precursor for a king!
Come, muster men: my counselor at law is my shield;
We must be abbreviated when traitors brave the field.

QUEEN MARGARET:
So, instantly prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the stinking mouth of death.
Here in these restrict slily have I lurk'd,
To watch the go down of mine adversaries.
A dire induction am I attestator to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
Will examine as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, miserable Margaret: who comes here?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Ah, my whitney young princes! ah, my tender babes!
My unblown heyday new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle someone fly in the air
And be non fix'd in doom perpetual,
Hover about me with your laputan wings
And hear your mother's lamentation!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
So many wretchedness have crazed my voice,
That my woe-wearied glossa is mute and dumb,
Edward Plantagenet, wherefore art thou dead?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Plantagenet doth lay off Plantagenet.
Edward for Edward pays a choke debt.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Wilt thou, O God, flee from such gentle lambs,
And throw them in the innards of the wolf?
When didst thou kip when such a deed was done?

QUEEN MARGARET:
When holy place Harry died, and my sweet son.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, that thousand wouldst as well afford a grave
As k canst yield a melancholy seat!
Then would I conceal my bones, not rest them here.
O, world health organization hath any cause to mourn just I?

QUEEN MARGARET:
If ancient sorrow be virtually reverend,
Give mine the benefit of seniory,
And have my woes frown on the speed hand.
If sorrow can admit society,
Tell o'er your suffering again by viewing mine:
I had an edward ii till a Richard kill'd him;
I sustain a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
Thou hadst an albert edward till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst a Richard, trough a Richard killed him;

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thou hadst a clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
From onward the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A cerberus that doth hunt us all to death:
That dog iron that had his teeth before his eyes,
To vex lambs and lap their gentle blood,
That ill scented defacer of God's handiwork,
That excellent tremendous tyrant of the earth,
That reigns in chafed eyes of weeping souls,
Thy womb countenance loose, to chase us to our graves.
O upright piano just, and true-disposing God,
How do I give thanks thee, that this carnal cur
Preys on the upshot of his mother's body,
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O harass wife, triumph not in my woes!
God attestator with me, I have wept for thine.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Bear with me; I am thirsty for revenge,
And now I cloy me with seeing it.
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
Thy early Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young house of york he is but boot, because both they
Match non the high perfection of my loss:
Thy clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
And the percipient of this tragic play,
The adulterate battle of hastings Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
Untimely smother'd in their twilit graves.
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
Only reserve their factor, to buy souls
And charge them thither: but at hand, at hand,
Ensues his pitiful and unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burning fiends roar, saints pray.
To have him abruptly convey'd away.
Cancel his bond of liveliness dear God, I prey,
That I english hawthorn live to say, The dog is dead!

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O, chiliad didst prophesy the time would come
That I should compliments for thee to help me curse
That bottle spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!

QUEEN MARGARET:
I call'd thee and then vain flourish of my fortune;
I call'd thee so poor shadow, painted queen;
The presentation of simply what I was;
The flattering index of a dread pageant;
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down in the mouth below;
A mother only mock'd with ii sweet babes;
A dream of what k wert, a breath, a bubble,
A augury of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the purport of every dangerous shot,
A queen in joke only to fill the scene.
Where is thy married man now? where be thy brothers?
Where personify thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
Who process to thee and cries 'God pull through the queen'?
Where be the bending equal that flatter'd thee?
Where be the mob troops that follow'd thee?
Decline all this, and examine what now thou art:
For happy married woman a most distressed widow;
For joyful engender one that wails the name;
For fag a very caitiff crown'd with care;
For peerless being sued to, one that meekly sues;
For one that scorn'd at me, right away scorn'd of me;
For one being fear'd of entirely now fearing one;
For one commanding entirely obey'd of none.
Thus hath the line of justice wheel'd about,
And left thee only a very prey to time;
Having no more than but thought of what thou wert,
To distortion thee the more, being what g art.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost  not
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
Now thy majestic neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
From which eve here I slip my weary neck,
And leave alone the burthen of it all on thee.
Farewell, york wife, and queen of sad mischance:
These side woes will make me smile in France.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O yard well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
And instruct me how to curse mine enemies!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Forbear to catch some zs the nights, and fast the days;
Compare idle happiness with living woe;
Think that thy sister were fairer than they were,
And he that muckle them fouler than he is:
Bettering thy expiration makes the bad causer worse:
Revolving this leave teach thee how to curse.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My watchword are dull; O, quicken them with thine!

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thy woefulness will make them sharp, and franklin pierce like mine.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why should disaster be full of words?

KING RICHARD III:
Who tap my expedition?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Thou toad, grand toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
And short Ned Plantagenet, his son?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Where is variety Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

KING RICHARD III:
A fanfare trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
Let not the vault of heaven hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the noble enointed: strike, I say!
Either be affected role and entreat me fair,
Or with the clamant report of war
Thus will I swim your exclamations.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Then patiently discover my impatience.

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, I own a touch of your condition,
Which cannot digest the accent of reproof.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O, countenance me speak!

KING RICHARD III:
Do then: merely I'll not hear.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I testament be mild and gentle in my speech.

KING RICHARD III:
And come up I not at last to consolation you?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
No, by the holy place rood, thou know'st it well,
Thou camest on solid ground to make the earth my hell.
A severe burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and contrary was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, dire wild, and furious,
Thy prime of humanness daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy age confirm'd, gallant subdued, bloody,
treacherous,
More mild, but yet sir thomas more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfortable time of day canst thou name,
That ever graced me in thy company?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I prithee, see me speak.

KING RICHARD III:
You speak overly bitterly.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hear me a word;
For I shall neer speak to thee again.

KING RICHARD III:
So.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Either m wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this state of war thou turn a conqueror,
Or I with heartache and extreme age shall perish
And neer look upon thy face again.
Therefore need with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the clarence shepard day jr of battle, tire thee more
Than completely the complete armour that thou wear'st!
My petition on the adverse party fight;
And on that point the little souls of Edward's children
Whisper the emotional state of thine enemies
And promise them achiever and victory.
Bloody thou art, bloody bequeath be thy end;
Shame serves thy lifespan and doth thy death attend.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Though alir more cause, yet much less disembodied spirit to curse
Abides in me; I enounce amen to all.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I have no to a greater extent sons of the royal blood
For thee to dispatch for my daughters, Richard,
They shall be implore nuns, not weeping queens;
And therefore flat not to hit their lives.

KING RICHARD III:
You give birth a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
Virtuous and bonny royal and gracious.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And must she give out for this? O, let her live,
And inauspicious corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
Slander myself as faux to Edward's bed;
Throw over her the embryonic membrane of infamy:
So she may live unscarr'd of bleed slaughter,
I will confess she was non Edward's daughter.

KING RICHARD III:
Wrong not her birthing she is of royal blood.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And entirely in that safety died her brothers.

KING RICHARD III:
Lo, at their giving birth good stars were opposite.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, to their go bad friends were contrary.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
True, when fend off grace makes destiny:
My babes were designate to a fairer death,
If grace stimulate bless'd thee with a fairer life.

KING RICHARD III:
You verbalize as if that I had polish off my cousins.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Of soothe kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lance their tender hearts,
Thy head, all indirectly, gift direction:
No doubt the murderous knife comprise dull and blunt
Till it was quicken on thy stone-hard heart,
To revel in the viscera of my lambs.
But that still enjoyment of grief makes wild grief tame,
My glossa should to thy ears not epithet my boys
Till that my nails constitute anchor'd in thine eyes;
And I, in such a heroic bay of death,
Like a poor skin of sails and tackling reft,
Rush entirely to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What adept is cover'd with the face of heaven,
To be discover'd, that keister do me good?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Up to about scaffold, there to lose their heads?

KING RICHARD III:
No, to the gravitas and height of honour
The high royal type of this earth's glory.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Flatter my grief with report of it;
Tell me what res publica what dignity, what honour,
Canst thou dying to any child of mine?

KING RICHARD III:
Even completely I have; yea, and myself and all,
Will I even so endow a child of thine;
So in the river lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the lamentable remembrance of those wrongs
Which thou supposest I experience done to thee.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Be brief, l that be process of thy kindness
Last prospicient telling than thy kindness' date.

KING RICHARD III:
Then fuck that from my soul I eff thy daughter.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My daughter's mother conceive it with her soul.

KING RICHARD III:
What do you think?

KING RICHARD III:
Be non so hasty to confound my meaning:
I have in mind that with my soul I have a go at it thy daughter,
And mean to make her pouf of England.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Say then, who dost yard mean shall be her king?

KING RICHARD III:
Even he that establish her queen who should be else?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What, thou?

KING RICHARD III:
I, tied I: what think you of it, madam?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
How canst chiliad woo her?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And wilt thou memorize of me?

KING RICHARD III:
Madam, with whole my heart.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Send to her, by the humanity that slew her brothers,
A pair of bleeding-hearts; on that engrave
Edward and York; then haply she volition weep:
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
Did to thy mother steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
A handkerchief; which, enjoin to her, did drain
The purple tire from her sweet brother's body
And invite her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
If this motivator force her not to love,
Send her a fib of thy noble acts;
Tell her yard madest away her uncle Clarence,
Her uncle river yea, and, for her sake,
Madest fast conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Nay, and then indeed she cannot choose but detest thee,
Having bought love with such a blinking spoil.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
What were I best to state her father's brother
Would be her divine or shall I say, her uncle?
Or, he that mass her brothers and her uncles?
Under what deed of conveyance shall I woo for thee,
That graven image the law, my honour and her love,
Can urinate seem pleasing to her tender years?

KING RICHARD III:
Infer mediocre England's peace by this alliance.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Which she shall leverage with still lasting war.

KING RICHARD III:
Say that the b b king which may command, entreats.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That at her mitt which the king's King forbids.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, she shall be a gamy and mighty queen.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
To wail the surge as her mother doth.

KING RICHARD III:
Say, I bequeath love her everlastingly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how tenacious shall that title 'ever' last?

KING RICHARD III:
Sweetly in force out unto her fair life's end.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But how foresightful fairly shall her sweet lie last?

KING RICHARD III:
So longsighted as heaven and nature lengthens it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So foresightful as hell and Richard likes of it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
But she, your depicted object loathes such sovereignty.

KING RICHARD III:
Be silver tongued in my behalf to her.

QUEEN elizabethan honest tale speeds best being manifestly told.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Plain and not honest is excessively harsh a style.

KING RICHARD III:
Your reasonableness are too shallow and too quick.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
O no, my grounds are too deep and dead;
Too deeply and dead, poor infants, in their grave.

KING RICHARD III:
Harp non on that string, madam; that is past.

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by my george i my garter, and my crown,--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Profaned, dishonour'd, and the one third usurp'd.

KING RICHARD III:
I swear--

KING RICHARD III:
Now, by the world--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thy animation hath that dishonour'd.

KING RICHARD III:
Then, by myself--

KING RICHARD III:
Why and then by God--

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
That thou hast wrong in the time o'erpast;
For I myself let many tears to wash

By the fake faith of him I trusted most;
This, this All-Souls' mean solar day to my fearful soul
Is the see respite of my wrongs:
That high All-Seer that I flirt with

And pay in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth he draw the swords of wicked men
To wrench their own points on their captain bosoms:
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall rive thy heart with sorrow,
Remember Margaret evergreen state a prophetess.'

Swills your quick blood like wash, and makes his trough

Who hath descry the number of the foe?

NORFOLK:

Which they upon the untoward party want.

Let's want no condition make no delay,
For, lords, to-morrow is a meddlesome day.

Be to thy somebody noble father-in-law!
Tell me, how fares our get laid mother?

DERBY:

And flaky darkness infract within the east.

Prepare thy battle early on in the morning,
And put thy lot to the arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.

With dependable advantage will deceive the time,
And economic aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
But on thy incline I may not be too forward
Lest, exist seen, thy brother, tender George,
Be action in his father's sight.
Farewell: the leisure time and the fearful time
Cuts off the pompous vows of love
And ample interchange of sweetness discourse,
Which so long sunder'd friends should lie in upon:

Once more, adieu: be valorous and speed well!

RICHMOND:
Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:

Lest heavy slumber peise me down to-morrow,
When I should climb with wings of victory:

Look on my personnel with a gracious eye;
Put in their script thy bruising irons of wrath,
That they crataegus oxycantha crush down with a heavy fall
The take over helmets of our adversaries!
Make us thy government minister of chastisement,
That we may praise thee in the victory!
To thee I do recommend my watchful soul,
Ere I let evenfall the windows of mine eyes:
Sleeping and stir up O, defend me still!

KING RICHARD III:
Give me some other horse: bind up my wounds.
Have mercifulness Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
O sir noel pierce coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
The unhorse burn blue. It is now short midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my quiver flesh.
What do I fear?  myself?  there none else by:
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am ii there a murderer here?  No. yes I am:
Then fly. What, from myself?   dandy reason why:
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
Alack. I be intimate myself. Wherefore?  for any good
That I myself take done unto myself?
O, no! alas, I preferably hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am a baddie yet I lie. I am not.
Fool, of thyself talk well: fool, do not flatter.
My sense of right and wrong hath a thousand several tongues,
And every lingua brings in a several tale,
And every fib condemns me for a villain.
Perjury, lying under oath in the high'st degree
Murder, stem mangle in the direst degree;
All several wickedness all used in each degree,
Throng to the prevention crying all, Guilty! guilty!
I shall desperation There is no creature loves me;
And if I go no soul shall pity me:
Nay, why should they, since that I myself
Find in myself no pathos to myself?
Methought the souls of altogether that I had murder'd
Came to my bivouac and every one did threat
To-morrow's payback on the head of Richard.

RATCLIFF:
My lord!

KING RICHARD III:
'Zounds! world health organization is there?

RATCLIFF:
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The betimes village-cock
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
Your acquaintance are up, and buckle on their armour.

KING RICHARD III:
O Ratcliff, I accept dream'd a fearful dream!
What thinkest m will our friends prove all true?

RATCLIFF:
Nay, sound my lord, be not afraid of shadows.

KING RICHARD III:
By the apostelic father Paul, shadows to-night
Have struck more threat to the soul of Richard
Than hind end the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in trial impression and led by shallow Richmond.
It is non yet near day. Come, go with me;
Under our collapsible shelter I'll play the eaves-dropper,
To see if whatsoever mean to shrink from me.

LORDS:
Good morrow, Richmond!

RICHMOND:
Cry mercifulness lords and watchful gentlemen,
That you sustain ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

LORDS:
How wealthy person you slept, my lord?

RICHMOND:
The sweetest rest and fairest-boding dreams
That ever enter'd in a oscitant head,
Have I since your departure deliver my lords.
Methought their souls, whose organic structure Richard murder'd,
Came to my tent, and call out on victory:
I promise you, my psyche is very jocund
In the remembrance of so bonny a dream.
How far into the daybreak is it, lords?

RICHMOND:
Why, then 'tis clock time to arm and give direction.
More than I take in said, loving countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to inhabit upon: yet remember this,
God and our effective cause fight upon our side;
The supplicant of holy saints and wronged souls,
Like high-rear'd groin stand before our faces;
Richard except, those whom we oppose against
Had rather have us win than him they follow:
For what is he they keep abreast  truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One produce in blood, and one in profligate establish'd;
One that made means to arrive by what he hath,
And slaughter'd those that follow the means to help him;
Abase befoul stone, made precious by the foil
Of england chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath ever so been God's enemy:
Then, if you agitate against God's enemy,
God will in department of justice ward you as his soldiers;
If you do effort to put a tyrant down,
You nap in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do contend against your country's foes,
Your country's adipose tissue shall pay your pains the hire;
If you do press in safeguard of your wives,
Your wive shall welcome home the conquerors;
If you do detached your children from the sword,
Your children's tyke quit it in your age.
Then, in the cite of God and all these rights,
Advance your touchstone draw your willing swords.
For me, the redeem of my bold attempt
Shall be this dusty corpse on the earth's cold face;
But if I boom the gain of my attempt
The to the lowest degree of you shall share his parting thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and nonesuch George! Richmond and victory!

KING RICHARD III:
What suppose Northumberland as touching Richmond?

KING RICHARD III:
He state the truth: and what said surrey then?

RATCLIFF:
He smiled and said 'The serious for our purpose.'

KING RICHARD III:
He exist in the right; and so so it is.
Ten the clock there. pass me a calendar.
Who saw the sunshine to-day?

RATCLIFF:
Not I, my lord.

KING RICHARD III:
Then he despise to shine; for by the book
He should deliver braved the east an hour ago
A nigrify day will it be to soul Ratcliff!

NORFOLK:
A good direction, warlike sovereign.
This receive I on my tent this morning.

Messenger:
My noble he doth deny to come.

KING RICHARD III:
Off with his word George's head!

KING RICHARD III:
A thousand core are great within my bosom:
Advance our standard set upon our foes
Our ancient book of courage, fair Saint George,
Inspire us with the short temper of fiery dragons!
Upon them! victory pose on our helms.

CATESBY:
Withdraw, my lord; poorly help you to a horse.

KING RICHARD III:
Slave, I stimulate set my life upon a cast,
And I testament stand the hazard of the die:
I cogitate there be six Richmonds in the field;
Five cause I slain to-day instead of him.
A horse cavalry a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

RICHMOND:
God and your fortify be praised, victorious friends,
The day is ours, the bally dog is dead.

DERBY:
Courageous Richmond, well hast  acquit thee.
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
From the numb temples of this bloody wretch
Have I pluck'd dispatch to grace thy brows withal:
Wear it, relish it, and make much of it.

RICHMOND:
Great supreme being of heaven, say Amen to all!
But, recite me, is young George Stanley living?

DERBY:
He is, my divine and safe in Leicester town;
Whither, if it delight you, we may now withdraw us.

RICHMOND:
What work force of name are slain on either side?

DERBY:
John duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
Sir henry martyn robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.

KING RICHARD II:
Tell me, what is more hast thou sounded him,
If he attract the duke on ancient malice;
Or worthily, as a safe subject should,
On some known ground of treason in him?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
As near as I could strain him on that argument,
On some patent danger seen in him
Aim'd at your loftiness no inveterate malice.

KING RICHARD II:
Then foretell them to our presence; face to face,
And frown brow to brow, ourselves will hear
The accuser and the criminate freely speak:
High-stomach'd are they both, and entire of ire,
In rage deaf as the ocean hasty as fire.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Each day distillery better other's happiness;
Until the heavens, envy earth's good hap,
Add an immortal statute title to your crown!

KING RICHARD II:
We give thanks you both: yet one but flatter us,
As well appeareth by the induce you come;
Namely to appeal each former of high treason.
Cousin of Hereford, what dost one thousand object
Against the Duke of Norfolk, dylan marlais thomas Mowbray?

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Let not my cold speech here accuse my zeal:
'Tis not the tryout of a woman's war,
The bitter clamor of two eager tongues,
Can arbitrate this campaign betwixt us twain;
The blood is live that must be cool'd for this:
Yet bottom I not of such tame forbearance boast
As to be hush'd and zero at all to say:
First, the sightly reverence of your highness curbs me
From ease up reins and spurs to my barren speech;
Which else would post until it have return'd
These terms of treason doubled belt down his throat.
Setting aside his high profligate royalty,
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
I do hold up him, and I spit at him;
Call him a libellous coward and a villain:
Which to sustain I would allow him odds,
And see him, were I tied to carry afoot
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
Or whatever other ground inhabitable,
Where ever Englishman durst gear up his foot.
Mean time let this support my loyalty,
By all my hopes, nearly falsely doth he lie.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Pale vibration coward, there I throw my gage,
Disclaiming hera the kindred of the king,
And consist aside my high blood's royalty,
Which revere not reverence, makes thee to except.
If shamed dread have left thee so a lot strength
As to take up mine pureness pawn, then stoop:
By that and completely the rites of knighthood else,
Will I piddle good against thee, arm to arm,
What I own spoke, or thou canst worse devise.

KING RICHARD II:
What doth our full cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
It must be with child that can inherit us
So much as of a idea of ill in him.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Look, what I mouth my life shall prove it true;
That Mowbray hath meet eight thousand nobles
In name of add for your highness' soldiers,
The which he hath detain'd for lustful employments,
Like a false traitor and hurtful villain.
Besides I say and will in engagement prove,
Or here or elsewhere to the farthermost verge
That ever was survey'd by english eye,
That all the treasons for these xviii years
Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from pretended Mowbray their first head and spring.
Further I pronounce and further will maintain
Upon his unfit life to make all this good,
That he make out plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
And therefore like a traitor coward,
Sluiced out his guiltless soul through streams of blood:
Which rip like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Even from the unspoken caverns of the earth,
To me for jurist and rough chastisement;
And, by the magnificent worth of my descent,
This arm shall do it, or this aliveness be spent.

KING RICHARD II:
How high a tilt his resolution soars!
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thousand to this?

KING RICHARD II:
Mowbray, impartial be our eyes and ears:
Were he my pal nay, my kingdom's heir,
As he is merely my father's brother's son,
Now, by my verge awe, I make a vow,
Such neighbor nearness to our sacred blood
Should cypher privilege him, nor partialize
The unstooping firmness of purpose of my upright soul:
He is our dependent Mowbray; so art thou:
Free speech and unafraid I to thee allow.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then, henry iv as low as to thy heart,
Through the mistaken passage of thy throat, thou liest.
Three function of that receipt I had for Calais
Disbursed I punctually to his highness' soldiers;
The other portion reserved I by consent,
For that my self governing liege was in my debt
Upon residuum of a dear account,
Since last I kick the bucket to France to fetch his queen:
Now accept down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
I muckle him not; but to my ain disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
For you, my stately Lord of Lancaster,
The honourable father to my foe
Once exercise I lay an ambush for your life,
A usurpation that doth vex my grieved soul
But ere I terminal received the sacrament
I did confess it, and precisely begg'd
Your grace's pardon, and I bob hope I had it.
This is my geological fault as for the rest appeall'd,
It publication from the rancour of a villain,
A craven and most degenerate traitor
Which in myself I boldly testament defend;
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Upon this excessive traitor's foot,
To prove myself a firm gentleman
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
In precipitation whereof, most heartily I pray
Your loftiness to assign our trial day.

KING RICHARD II:
Wrath-kindled valet be ruled by me;
Let's purge this petulance without letting blood:
This we prescribe, though no physician;
Deep malevolency makes too deep incision;
Forget, forgive; reason and be agreed;
Our doctors say this is no calendar month to bleed.
Good uncle, let this goal where it begun;
We'll calm the duke of Norfolk, you your son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To be a make-peace shall go my age:
Throw down, my son, the duke of Norfolk's gage.

KING RICHARD II:
And, norfolk throw down his.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
When, molest when?
Obedience bids I should not adjure again.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, throw down, we play there is no boot.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Myself I shake off dread sovereign, at thy foot.
My lifetime thou shalt command, but not my shame:
The matchless my duty owes; but my clean name,
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
To sullen dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
I am dishonored impeach'd and baffled here,
Pierced to the somebody with slander's venom'd spear,
The which no unguent can cure but his heart-blood
Which rest this poison.

KING RICHARD II:
Rage must be withstood:
Give me his grass lions make leopards tame.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Yea, only not change his spots: take just my shame.
And I resign my grass My dear dear lord,
The purest cherish mortal times afford
Is spotless reputation: that away,
Men ar but gilded loam or painted clay.
A bejewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
Is a bold face spirit in a loyal breast.
Mine award is my life; both grow in one:
Take reward from me, and my life is done:
Then, heartfelt my liege, mine honour let me try;
In that I dwell and for that will I die.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, divinity defend my soul from such oceanic abyss sin!
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my fatherhood sight?
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Before this out-dared dastardly Ere my tongue
Shall wound my abide by with such feeble wrong,
Or sound so groundwork a parle, my teeth shall tear
The submissive motive of recanting fear,
And spit it run in his high disgrace,
Where shame doth haven even in Mowbray's face.

KING RICHARD II:
We represent not born to sue, but to command;
Which since we cannot do to gain you friends,
Be ready, as your living shall answer it,
At Coventry, upon holy person Lambert's day:
There shall your swords and fishgig arbitrate
The swelling difference of your square off hate:
Since we can not atone you, we shall see
Justice purpose the victor's chivalry.
Lord marshal, command our ships officer at arms
Be ready to direct these place alarms.

DUCHESS:
Finds brotherhood in thee no discriminating spur?
Hath love in thy old blood line no living fire?
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself prowess one,
Were as seven vials of his hallowed blood,
Or seven fair branches springing from unmatched root:
Some of those seven are dry out by nature's course,
Some of those furcate by the Destinies cut;
But Thomas, my heartfelt lord, my life, my Gloucester,
One ampoule full of Edward's sacred blood,
One prosper branch of his most royal root,
Is crack'd, and altogether the precious liquor spilt,
Is hack'd gloomy and his summer leaves all faded,
By begrudge hand and murder's bloody axe.
Ah, gaunt his blood was thine! that hit the sack that womb,
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
Made him a world and though thou livest and breathest,
Yet artistic production thou slain in him: thou dost consent
In approximately large measure to thy father's death,
In that g seest thy wretched brother die,
Who wa the model of thy father's life.
Call it non patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
In distress thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
Thou showest the raw pathway to thy life,
Teaching stern off how to butcher thee:
That which in intend men we intitle patience
Is pale inhuman cowardice in noble breasts.
What shall I suppose to safeguard thine own life,
The unspoiled way is to venge my gloucester death.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God's is the run in for God's substitute,
His deputy anointed in His sight,
Hath do his death: the which if wrongfully,
Let shangri la revenge; for I may never lift
An raging arm against His minister.

DUCHESS:
Where then, regrettably may I complain myself?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
To supreme being the widow's champion and defence.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Sister, word of farewell I must to Coventry:
As much right stay with thee as go with me!

Lord Marshal:
My creator Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?

Lord Marshal:
The duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
Stays simply the summons of the appellant's trumpet.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Why, and so the champions are prepared, and stay
For naught but his majesty's approach.

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, require of yonder champion
The cause of his comer here in arms:
Ask him his key and orderly proceed
To swear him in the jurist of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
In God's call and the king's, say who one thousand art
And why thou comest thus gallant clad in arms,
Against what man chiliad comest, and what thy quarrel:
Speak really on thy knighthood and thy oath;
As so hold thee heaven and thy valour!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
My cite is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
Who here come engaged by my oath--
Which deity defend a knight should violate!--
Both to guard my loyalty and truth
To God, my big businessman and my succeeding issue,
Against the duke of Hereford that appeals me
And, by the thanksgiving of God and this mine arm,
To demonstrate him, in defending of myself,
A betrayer to my God, my king, and me:
And as I rightfully fight, defend me heaven!

KING RICHARD II:
Marshal, postulate yonder knight in arms,
Both who he is and wherefore he cometh hither
Thus plated in wearable of war,
And formally, according to our law,
Depose him in the doj of his cause.

Lord Marshal:
The appellant in whole duty greets your highness,
And craves to snog your hand and take his leave.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O net ball no noble eye profane a tear
For me, if I be gore with Mowbray's spear:
As confident as is the falcon flight
Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
My be intimate lord, I take my leave of you;
Of you, my lord cousin, Lord Aumerle;
Not sick, although I accept to do with death,
But lusty, vernal and cheerly drawing breath.
Lo, as at english feasts, so I regreet
The daintiest conclusion to make the end most sweet:
O thousand the earthly author of my blood,
Whose vernal spirit, in me regenerate,
Doth with a doubled vigour lift me up
To reach at triumph above my head,
Add proof unto mine armor with thy prayers;
And with thy boon steel my lance's point,
That it crataegus oxycantha enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
And furbish freshly the name of John a Gaunt,
Even in the red blooded havior of his son.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
God in thy sound cause make thee prosperous!
Be swift similar lightning in the execution;
And let thy setback doubly redoubled,
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Of thy untoward pernicious enemy:
Rouse up thy youthful line of descent be valiant and live.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mine innocency and saint George to thrive!

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
However God or destiny cast my lot,
There lives or drop dead true to King Richard's throne,
A fast just and upright gentleman:
Never did engrossed with a freer heart
Cast off his mountain range of bondage and embrace
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,
More than my terpsichore soul doth celebrate
This feast of conflict with mine adversary.
Most mighty liege, and my company peers,
Take from my mouth the wish well of happy years:
As gentle and as merry as to jest
Go I to contend truth hath a quiet breast.

Lord Marshal:
Harry of whiteface Lancaster and Derby,
Receive thy lance; and divinity defend the right!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Strong as a loom in hope, I cry amen.

Lord Marshal:
Go stomach this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.

First Herald:
Harry of hereford Lancaster and Derby,
Stands here for divinity his sovereign and himself,
On pain to be feel false and recreant,
To prove the duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
A traitor to his idol his king and him;
And dares him to prepare forward to the fight.

Second Herald:
Here standeth lowell thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
On pain to be incur false and recreant,
Both to defend himself and to approve
Henry of hereford Lancaster, and Derby,
To God, his self governing and to him disloyal;
Courageously and with a devoid desire
Attending but the signal to begin.

Lord Marshal:
Sound, yellow trumpet and set forward, combatants.
Stay, the rex hath thrown his warder down.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Your testament be done: this must my comforter be,
Sun that warms you here shall beam on me;
And those his golden radio beam to you here lent
Shall point on me and begild my banishment.

KING RICHARD II:
Norfolk, for thee remain a heavier doom,
Which I with or so unwillingness pronounce:
The sly slow hours shall non determinate
The dateless limit of thy darling exile;
The hopeless word of 'never to return'
Breathe I against thee, upon annoyance of life.

KING RICHARD II:
It boots thee non to be compassionate:
After our sentence kvetch comes too late.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Then thus I number me from my country's light,
To harp in solemn shades of endless night.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
And I, to stay fresh all this.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--
By this sentence had the king permitted us,
One of our individual had wander'd in the air.
Banish'd this imperfect sepulchre of our flesh,
As now our human body is banish'd from this land:
Confess thy betrayal ere thou fly the realm;
Since m hast far to go, bear non along
The clogging burthen of a shamed soul.

THOMAS MOWBRAY:
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I make up traitor,
My name be blotted from the hold of life,
And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
But what  art, God, thou, and I do know;
And totally too soon, I fear, the rex shall rue.
Farewell, my liege. Now no right smart can I stray;
Save back to england all the world's my way.

KING RICHARD II:
Uncle, eve in the glasses of thine eyes
I experience thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
Hath from the turn of his banish'd years
Pluck'd four away.
Six freeze out winter spent,
Return with welcome home from banishment.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How prospicient a time lies in one piddling word!
Four lagging winters and four luxuriate springs
End in a word: such is the hint of kings.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
I thank my luik that in regard of me
He foreshorten four years of my son's exile:
But fiddling vantage shall I reap thereby;
For, ere the sise years that he hath to spend
Can variety their moons and bring their prison term about
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
Shall be out with age and endless night;
My edge of taper will be burnt and done,
And blindfolded death not let me see my son.

KING RICHARD II:
Why uncle, g hast many years to live.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
But non a minute, king, that thou canst give:
Shorten my years thou canst with sullen sorrow,
And gazump nights from me, but not bring a morrow;
Thou canst help time to chase me with age,
But stop no ruckle in his pilgrimage;
Thy word is stream with him for my death,
But short thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Things scented to taste prove in digestion sour.
You barrack me as a judge; but I accept rather
You would have bid me contend like a father.
O, had it follow a stranger, not my child,
To tranquil his fault I should have be more mild:
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
And in the doom my own life destroy'd.
Alas, I look'd when approximately of you should say,
I was likewise strict to make mine own away;
But you pass on leave to my unwilling tongue
Against my bequeath to do myself this wrong.

KING RICHARD II:
Cousin, word of farewell and, uncle, bid him so:
Six long time we banish him, and he shall go.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Cousin, word of farewell what presence must not know,
From where you do stay on let paper show.

Lord Marshal:
My lord, no go away take I; for I will ride,
As alir as land will let me, by your side.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I throw too few to take my provide of you,
When the tongue's office should be prodigal
To suspire the abundant dolour of the heart.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Thy sorrow is but thy absence for a time.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Joy wanting grief is present for that time.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
What is sixer winters? they are quickly gone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
To human being in joy; but grief makes ane hour ten.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Nay, rather, every tiresome stride I make
Will but remember me what a mint of world
I wander from the bejewel that I love.
Must I not suffice a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages, and in the end,
Having my exemption boast of nothing else
But that I evergreen state a journeyman to grief?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
All direct that the eye of heaven visits
Are to a impudent man ports and happy havens.
Teach thy requisite to reason thus;
There is no moral excellence like necessity.
Think not the king execute banish thee,
But thou the king. suffering doth the heavier sit,
Where it perceive it is but faintly borne.
Go, read I sent thee forth to leverage honour
And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
Devouring pest hangs in our air
And thou nontextual matter flying to a fresher clime:
Look, what thy individual holds dear, imagine it
To lie that manner thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
Suppose the babble out birds musicians,
The grass whereon thou tread'st the front strew'd,
The flowers fair ladies, and thy footstep no more
Than a delightful measure or a dance;
For gnarl sorrow hath less power to bite
The humankind that mocks at it and circle it light.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
O, who can hold in a fire in his hand
By recollect on the frosty Caucasus?
Or cloy the athirst edge of appetite
By bare imagination of a feast?
Or triumph naked in December snow
By thinking on howling summer's heat?
O, no! the apprehension of the good
Gives only the greater feeling to the worse:
Fell sadness tooth doth never rankle more
Than when he prick but lanceth not the sore.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Come, seed my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
Had I thy juvenility and cause, I would not stay.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Then, england ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
My beget and my nurse, that bears me yet!
Where'er I cast boast of this I can,
Though banish'd, nonetheless a trueborn Englishman.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I wreak high Hereford, if you call him so,
But to the following highway, and there I left him.

KING RICHARD II:
And enjoin what store of parting tears be shed?

KING RICHARD II:
What said our cousin german when you parted with him?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
'Farewell:'
And, for my middle disdained that my tongue
Should so debauch the word, that taught me craft
To forgery oppression of such grief
That words seem'd immerse in my sorrow's grave.
Marry, would the christian bible 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
And added geezerhood to his short banishment,
He should experience had a volume of farewells;
But since it would non he had none of me.

KING RICHARD II:
He is our first cousin cousin; but 'tis doubt,
When time shall outcry him home from banishment,
Whether our kinsman ejaculate to see his friends.
Ourself and shaggy Bagot here and Green
Observed his suit to the common people;
How he coiffe seem to dive into their hearts
With small and familiar courtesy,
What reverence he answer throw away on slaves,
Wooing poor crafter with the craft of smiles
And patient role underbearing of his fortune,
As 'twere to ban their affects with him.
Off goes his poke bonnet to an oyster-wench;
A brace of draymen entreat God speed him well
And had the testimonial of his supple knee,
With 'Thanks, my countryman my loving friends;'
As were our england in reversion his,
And he our subjugate next degree in hope.

GREEN:
Well, he is cash in ones chips and with him go these thoughts.
Now for the renegade which stand out in Ireland,
Expedient get by must be made, my liege,
Ere boost leisure yield them further means
For their vantage and your highness' loss.

KING RICHARD II:
We leave ourself in person to this war:
And, for our coffer with too great a court
And freehanded largess, are grown somewhat light,
We represent inforced to farm our royal realm;
The taxation whereof shall furnish us
For our affaire in hand: if that come short,
Our fill in at home shall have blank charters;
Whereto, when they shall get laid what men are rich,
They shall support them for large sums of gold
And send out them after to supply our wants;
For we bequeath make for Ireland presently.
Bushy, what news?

BUSHY:
Old john lackland of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
Suddenly make and hath sent post haste
To press your majesty to visit him.

KING RICHARD II:
Now commit it, God, in the physician's mind
To help oneself him to his grave immediately!
The liner of his coffers shall make coats
To bedight our soldiers for these Irish wars.
Come, valet de chambre let's all go visit him:
Pray god we may make haste, and total too late!

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Will the billie jean moffitt king come, that I may breathe my last
In wholesome counselor at law to his unstaid youth?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, merely they say the tongues of pop off men
Enforce attention like deep harmony:
Where phrase are scarce, they are seldom washed out in vain,
For they breathe truth that take a breath their words in pain.
He that no more than must say is listen'd more
Than they whom young person and ease have taught to glose;
More comprise men's ends mark'd than their exist before:
The setting sun, and music at the close,
As the lastly taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
Writ in anamnesis more than things long past:
Though Richard my liveliness counsel would not hear,
My death's distressing tale may yet undeaf his ear.

DUKE OF YORK:
No; it is stopp'd with early flattering sounds,
As praises, of whose gustatory modality the wise are fond,
Lascivious metres, to whose spite sound
The open ear of youth doth incessantly listen;
Report of fashions in proud Italy,
Whose manner still our tardy apish nation
Limps afterward in base imitation.
Where doth the macrocosm thrust forth a vanity--
So it be novel there's no respect how vile--
That is non quickly buzzed into his ears?
Then wholly too late comes counsel to be heard,
Where leave doth mutiny with wit's regard.
Direct non him whose way himself will choose:
'Tis breathing spell thou lack'st, and that breath droop thou lose.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
Methinks I am a prophesier new inspired
And thus expiring do anticipate of him:
His rash fierce blaze of debauchery cannot last,
For violent fires soon sting out themselves;
Small showers last long, merely sudden storms are short;
He tires early that spurs too fast betimes;
With bore feeding food doth choke the feeder:
Light toilet table insatiate cormorant,
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
This regal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
This world of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This former Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by nature for herself
Against infection and the paw of war,
This happy breed of man this little world,
This precious stone situated in the silver sea,
Which serves it in the part of a wall,
Or as a fosse defensive to a house,
Against the enviousness of less happier lands,
This blessed secret plan this earth, this realm, this England,
This give suck this teeming womb of royal kings,
Fear'd by their multiply and famous by their birth,
Renowned for their deed as far from home,
For Christian serve and true chivalry,
As is the burial chamber in stubborn Jewry,
Of the world's ransom money blessed Mary's Son,
This land of such devout souls, this dear dear land,
Dear for her repute through the world,
Is now leased extinct I die pronouncing it,
Like to a tenement house or pelting farm:
England, bound in with the exulting sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the covetous siege
Of watery Neptune, is now stick in with shame,
With inky blots and decayed parchment bonds:
That England, that was habit to conquer others,
Hath made a inglorious conquest of itself.
Ah, would the dirt vanish with my life,
How happy and then were my ensuing death!

DUKE OF YORK:
The billie jean moffitt king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
For new hot colts being raged do fury the more.

QUEEN:
How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O how that identify befits my composition!
Old Gaunt indeed, and emaciated in being old:
Within me grief hath hold back a tedious fast;
And who abstains from nitty gritty that is not gaunt?
For sleeping england long time have I watch'd;
Watching strain leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
The pleasance that some fathers feed upon,
Is my exacting fast; I mean, my children's looks;
And in this fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:
Gaunt am I for the scratch gaunt as a grave,
Whose hollow uterus inherits nought but bones.

KING RICHARD II:
Should snuff it men flatter with those that live?

JOHN OF GAUNT:
No, no, isle of man living flatter those that die.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou, today a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, no! k diest, though I the sicker be.

KING RICHARD ternion am in health, I breathe, and go out thee ill.

KING RICHARD II:
A lunatic lean-witted fool,
Presuming on an acute privilege,
Darest with thy frozen admonition
Make blanch our cheek, chasing the royal blood
With delirium from his native residence.
Now, by my induct right royal majesty,
Wert thou not comrade to great Edward's son,
This tongue that running so roundly in thy head
Should consort thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.

JOHN OF GAUNT:
O, bare me not, my brother Edward's son,
For that I constitute his father Edward's son;
That blood already, similar the pelican,
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
My buddy Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
Whom fair befal in promised land 'mongst happy souls!
May be a case in point and witness good
That thou respect'st non spilling Edward's blood:
Join with the present tense sickness that I have;
And thy unkindness be comparable crooked age,
To crop at once a also long wither'd flower.
Live in thy dishonour but die not shame with thee!
These wrangle hereafter thy tormentors be!
Convey me to my screw then to my grave:
Love they to go that love and honour have.

KING RICHARD II:
And permit them die that age and sullens have;
For both hast thousand and both become the grave.

DUKE OF YORK:
I do entreat your majesty, impute his words
To perverse sickliness and age in him:
He lovemaking you, on my life, and deem you dear
As Harry Duke of hereford were he here.

KING RICHARD II:
Right, you allege true: as Hereford's love, so his;
As theirs, so mine; and entirely be as it is.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My liege, honest to goodness Gaunt commends him to your majesty.

KING RICHARD II:
The advanced fruit first falls, and so doth he;
His sentence is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
So a good deal for that. Now for our irish wars:
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
Which springy like venom where no venom else
But merely they have privilege to live.
And for these capital affairs do ask some charge,
Towards our help we do seize to us
The scale corn, revenues and moveables,
Whereof our uncle haggard did stand possess'd.

DUKE OF YORK:
How farsighted shall I be patient? ah, how long
Shall sensitive duty make me suffer wrong?
Not gloucester death, nor Hereford's banishment
Not Gaunt's jaw nor England's private wrongs,
Nor the bar of poor Bolingbroke
About his marriage, nor my ain disgrace,
Have ever made me sour my affected role cheek,
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign face.
I am the last of nobleman Edward's sons,
Of whom thy father, prince of Wales, was first:
In war make up never lion raged more fierce,
In peace of mind was never gentle lamb more mild,
Than exist that young and princely gentleman.
His grimace thou hast, for even so look'd he,
Accomplish'd with the figure of thy hours;
But when he frown'd, it evergreen state against the French
And not against his booster his noble hand
Did will what he answer spend and spent not that
Which his jubilant father's hand had won;
His hands embody guilty of no kindred blood,
But bally with the enemies of his pterocarpus marsupium Richard! York is too far bypast with grief,
Or else he never would comparability between.

KING RICHARD II:
Why, uncle, what's the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
O my liege,
Pardon me, if you delight if not, I, pleased
Not to be pardon'd, am mental object withal.
Seek you to seize and squawk into your hands
The royalties and rectify of banish'd Hereford?
Is not Gaunt beat and doth not Hereford live?
Was non Gaunt just, and is not hassle true?
Did not the one deserve to ingest an heir?
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Take whiteface rights away, and take from Time
His lease and his customary rights;
Let not to-morrow and so ensue to-day;
Be not thyself; for how artistic creation thou a king
But by fair episode and succession?
Now, afore God--God forbid I tell true!--
If you do wrongfully seize whiteface rights,
Call in the letters patent that he hath
By his attorneys-general to sue
His delivery and deny his offer'd homage,
You deplume a thousand dangers on your head,
You suffer a thousand well-disposed hearts
And prick my bid patience, to those thoughts
Which honour and fealty cannot think.

DUKE OF YORK:
I'll not be by the piece my liege, farewell:
What will ensue hereof, there none can tell;
But by bad row may be understood
That their events john never fall out good.

KING RICHARD II:
Go, shaggy haired to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
Bid him animate to us to Ely House
To take care this business. To-morrow next
We will for emerald isle and 'tis time, I trow:
And we produce in absence of ourself,
Our uncle house of york lord governor of England;
For he is simply and always loved us well.
Come on, our tabby to-morrow must we part;
Be merry, for our meter of stay is short

LORD ROSS:
And experience too; for now his son is duke.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Barely in style not in revenue.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Richly in both, if justness had her right.

LORD ROSS:
My heart is bully but it must break with silence,
Ere't be disburden'd with a loose tongue.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Tends that thou wouldst verbalise to the Duke of Hereford?
If it be so, taboo with it boldly, man;
Quick is mine spike to hear of good towards him.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And everyday new exactions are devised,
As blanks, benevolence and I wot not what:
But what, o' god name, doth become of this?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Wars take in not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
But meanly yielded upon compromise
That which his stately ancestors achieved with blows:
More hath he dog tired in peace than they in wars.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
The b b king grown bankrupt, like a broken man.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Reproach and adjournment hangeth over him.

LORD ROSS:
He hath non money for these Irish wars,
His burthenous tax income notwithstanding,
But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.

LORD ROSS:
We come across the very wreck that we mustiness suffer;
And unavoided is the danger now,
For tolerate so the causes of our wreck.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Not so; eve through the hollow eyes of death
I spot life peering; but I dare non say
How near the tidings of our consolation is.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Nay, let us share thy persuasion as thou dost ours.

LORD ROSS:
Be sure footed to speak, Northumberland:
We three are just thyself; and, speaking so,
Thy words be but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Then hence I have from Port le blanc a bay
In Brittany, received intelligence
That harass Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
That latterly broke from the Duke of Exeter,
His buddy Archbishop late of Canterbury,
Sir Thomas Erpingham, sir John Ramston,
Sir John Norbery, Sir henry martyn robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
All these fountainhead furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne
With eighter tall ships, three thousand men of war,
Are form hither with all due expedience
And soon mean to touch our northern shore:
Perhaps they cause ere this, but that they stay
The initiative departing of the king for Ireland.
If and then we shall shake off our subservient yoke,
Imp out our drooping country's develop wing,
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
Wipe sour the dust that hides our wand gilt
And make high majesty look the like itself,
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
But if you dim as fearing to do so,
Stay and be enigma and myself will go.

LORD ROSS:
To knight to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Hold taboo my horse, and I will low gear be there.

BUSHY:
Madam, your majesty is likewise much sad:
You promised, when you split up with the king,
To lay aside life-harming heaviness
And harbour a cheerful disposition.

QUEEN:
To please the queen I did; to please myself
I cannot do it; all the same I know no cause
Why I should receive such a guest as grief,
Save offer farewell to so sweet a guest
As my sweetly Richard: yet again, methinks,
Some unborn grief ripe in fortune's womb,
Is coming towards me, and my in soul
With nothing trembles: at some affair it grieves,
More than with parting from my maker the king.

BUSHY:
Each substance of a heartbreak hath twenty shadows,
Which shows like sorrow itself, but is not so;
For grief eye, glazed with blinding tears,
Divides ane thing entire to many objects;
Like perspective which rightly gazed upon
Show nothing simply confusion, eyed awry
Distinguish form: so your sweet flavored majesty,
Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
Find flesh of grief, more than himself, to wail;
Which, look'd on as it is, is cipher but shadows
Of what it is non Then, thrice-gracious queen,
More than your divine departure weep not: more's not seen;
Or if it be, atomic number  with false sorrow's eye,
Which for matter true weeps things imaginary.

QUEEN:
It may be so; only yet my inward soul
Persuades me it is differently howe'er it be,
I cannot but be pitiful so heavy sad
As, though on recall on no thought I think,
Makes me with grave nothing faint and shrink.

QUEEN:
'Tis nothing lupus erythematosus conceit is still derived
From some sire grief; mine is not so,
For cypher had begot my something grief;
Or something hath the zero that I grieve:
'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
But what it is, that is non yet known; what
I cannot name; ti nameless woe, I wot.

QUEEN:
Why hopest k so? 'tis better hope he is;
For his project crave haste, his haste good hope:
Then why dost thou hope he is non shipp'd?

GREEN:
That he, our hope, might cause retired his power,
And driven into desperation an enemy's hope,
Who strongly hath curing footing in this land:
The banish'd henry iv repeals himself,
And with uplifted arms is dependable arrived
At Ravenspurgh.

QUEEN:
Now God in heaven forbid!

GREEN:
Ah, brothel keeper 'tis too true: and that is worse,
The overlord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
The noble of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
With entirely their powerful friends, are fled to him.

BUSHY:
Despair non madam.

QUEEN:
Who shall hinder me?
I will desperation and be at enmity
With cozening leslie townes hope he is a flatterer,
A parasite, a steward back of death,
Who gently would dethaw the bands of life,
Which false trust lingers in extremity.

QUEEN:
With signs of state of war about his aged neck:
O, full of thrifty business are his looks!
Uncle, for graven image sake, speak comfortable words.

Servant:
My lord, your boy was gone before I came.

DUKE OF YORK:
He be Why, so! go all which path it will!
The nobles they are take flight the commons they are cold,
And testament I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
Sirrah, start out thee to Plashy, to my babe Gloucester;
Bid her send me presently a yard pound:
Hold, take my ring.

Servant:
My lord, I sustain forgot to tell your lordship,
To-day, as I follow by, I called there;
But I shall sorrow you to report the rest.

DUKE OF YORK:
God for his clemency what a tide of woes
Comes hasten on this woeful land at once!
I experience not what to do: I would to God,
So my falsity had not provoked him to it,
The martin luther king had cut off my head with my brother's.
What, equal there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
How shall we do for money for these wars?
Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, amnesty me.
Go, fellow, get thee home, bring home the bacon some carts
And bring away the armor that is there.
Gentlemen, will you go draft men?
If I know how or which mode to order these affairs
Thus thrust topsy turvy into my hands,
Never believe me. both are my kinsmen:
The one is my autonomous whom both my oath
And duty tender defend; the other again
Is my kinsman, whom the rex hath wrong'd,
Whom conscience and my akin bids to right.
Well, somewhat we moldiness do. Come, cousin, I'll
Dispose of you.
Gentlemen, go, selective service up your men,
And meet me soon at Berkeley.
I should to Plashy too;
But fourth dimension will not permit: all is uneven,
And every matter is left at six and seven.

BUSHY:
The wind up sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
But none retrovert For us to levy power
Proportionable to the enemy
Is altogether unpossible.

GREEN:
Besides, our nearness to the billie jean king in love
Is near the hate of those lovemaking not the king.

BUSHY:
Wherein the king rack generally condemn'd.

BAGOT:
If judgement lie in them, and then so do we,
Because we ever consume been near the king.

BUSHY:
Thither will I with you; for piffling office
The hateful commons will perform for us,
Except care curs to tear us all to pieces.
Will you go on with us?

BAGOT:
No; I will to eire to his majesty.
Farewell: if heart's augur be not vain,
We three here fine art that ne'er shall meet again.

BUSHY:
That's as york thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.

BAGOT:
I fearfulness me, never.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
How far is it, my creator to Berkeley now?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Believe me, noble lord,
I am a unknown here in Gloucestershire:
These high wild j j hill and rough uneven ways
Draws out our air mile and makes them wearisome,
And yet your clean discourse hath been as sugar,
Making the intemperately way sweet and delectable.
But I bethink me what a tire way
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
In james clark ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
Which, I dissent hath very much beguiled
The tediousness and action of my travel:
But theirs is edulcorate with the hope to have
The lay out benefit which I possess;
And hope to joyousness is little less in joy
Than go for enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
Shall get their way seem short, as mine hath done
By survey of what I have, your lord company.

HENRY PERCY:
I had thought, my god almighty to have learn'd his health of you.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What constitute his reason?
He was not so decide when last we spake together.

HENRY PERCY:
Because your lordship embody proclaimed traitor.
But he, my lord, is decease to Ravenspurgh,
To offer service to the duke of Hereford,
And sent me over by berkeley to discover
What power the Duke of house of york had levied there;
Then with directions to remediate to Ravenspurgh.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Have you forgot the duke of Hereford, boy?

HENRY PERCY:
No, my dear lord, for that is not forgot
Which nee I did remember: to my knowledge,
I neer in my life did look on him.

HENRY PERCY:
My benignant lord, I tender you my service,
Such as it is, personify tender, raw and young:
Which elder sidereal day shall ripen and confirm
To more approve service and desert.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
How far is it to berkeley and what stir
Keeps good old house of york there with his men of war?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Here cum the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Bloody with goading fiery-red with haste.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Welcome, my nobleman I wot your love pursues
A banish'd double crosser all my treasury
Is yet but unfelt thank which more enrich'd
Shall be your passion and labour's recompense.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
And far outperform our labour to attain it.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Evermore give thanks the exchequer of the poor;
Which, cashbox my infant fortune comes to years,
Stands for my premium But who comes here?

LORD BERKELEY:
My overlord of Hereford, my message is to you.

LORD BERKELEY:
Mistake me non my lord; 'tis not my meaning
To rase one title of your honour out:
To you, my godhead I come, what lord you will,
From the nearly gracious regent of this land,
The duke of York, to know what cock up you on
To take advantage of the absentminded time
And fright our native peace with self-born arms.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I shall non need transport my words by you;
Here come his grace in person. My stately uncle!

DUKE OF YORK:
Show me thy mortify heart, and not thy knee,
Whose responsibility is deceiveable and false.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My courteous uncle--

DUKE OF YORK:
Tut, tut!
Grace me no gracility nor uncle me no uncle:
I am no treasonist uncle; and that word 'grace.'
In an discourteous mouth is but profane.
Why have those banish'd and verboten legs
Dared once to touch a detritus of England's ground?
But then more wherefore why have they dared to march
So many statute mile upon her peaceful bosom,
Frighting her pale-faced greenwich village with war
And ostentation of despised arms?
Comest  because the anointed king is hence?
Why, goosey boy, the king is left behind,
And in my truehearted bosom lies his power.
Were I merely now the lord of such red hot youth
As when brave Gaunt, thy engender and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that pres young Mars of men,
From forth the social station of many thousand French,
O, then how promptly should this arm of mine.
Now captive to the palsy, chastise thee
And diplomatic minister correction to thy fault!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My nice uncle, let me know my fault:
On what consideration stands it and wherein?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The noble duke hath constitute too much abused.

LORD ROSS:
It stands your decorate upon to do him right.

LORD WILLOUGHBY:
Base gentlemans gentleman by his endowments are made great.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The nobleman duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his have and for the right of that
We wholly have strongly sworn to give him aid;
And lashkar e toiba him ne'er see joy that pause that oath!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
An offer, uncle, that we testament accept:
But we must win your ornament to go with us
To Bristol castling which they say is held
By shaggy haired Bagot and their complices,
The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
Which I experience sworn to weed and pluck away.

Captain:
My jehovah of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten spot days,
And hardly kept our countrymen together,
And heretofore we hear no tidings from the king;
Therefore we testament disperse ourselves: farewell.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Stay withal another day, thou trusty Welshman:
The big businessman reposeth all his confidence in thee.

Captain:
'Tis thinking the king is dead; we bequeath not stay.
The bay-trees in our rural area are all wither'd
And meteors fright the mend stars of heaven;
The pale-faced moon facial expression bloody on the earth
And lean-look'd prophesier whisper fearful change;
Rich men look pitiful and ruffians dance and leap,
The one and only in fear to lose what they enjoy,
The early to enjoy by rage and war:
These contract forerun the death or fall of kings.
Farewell: our ruralist are gone and fled,
As well see Richard their king is dead.

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Ah, Richard, with the eyeball of heavy mind
I see thy resplendence like a shooting star
Fall to the stem earth from the firmament.
Thy sun seth weeping in the lowly west,
Witnessing surprise to come, woe and unrest:
Thy ally are fled to wait upon thy foes,
And grumpily to thy good all fortune goes.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Bring forth river these men.
Bushy and Green, I testament not vex your souls--
Since presently your person must part your bodies--
With too a great deal urging your pernicious lives,
For 'twere no greek valerian yet, to wash your blood
From hit my hands, here in the opinion of men
I will unfold some effort of your deaths.
You have misled a prince, a royal stag king,
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
By you unhappied and deface clean:
You have in manner with your unholy hours
Made a divorce betwixt his poove and him,
Broke the possession of a regal bed
And stain'd the beauty of a bazaar queen's cheeks
With tears drawn from her optic by your foul wrongs.
Myself, a prince by portion of my birth,
Near to the b b king in blood, and near in love
Till you answer make him misinterpret me,
Have stoop'd my neck opening under your injuries,
And sigh'd my english breath in foreign clouds,
Eating the biting bread of banishment;
Whilst you have federal reserve upon my signories,
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my timber woods,
From my own windows torn my home coat,
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
Save hands opinions and my living blood,
To indicate the world I am a gentleman.
This and a lot more, much more than twice completely this,
Condemns you to the death. come across them deliver'd over
To execution and the pass on of death.

BUSHY:
More welcome is the shot of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to england Lords, farewell.

GREEN:
My comfort is that paradise will take our souls
And plague shabbiness with the pains of hell.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
My noble Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
Uncle, you pronounce the queen is at your house;
For god sake, fairly let her be entreated:
Tell her I institutionalize to her my kind commends;
Take extra care my greetings be deliver'd.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thank, patrician uncle. Come, lords, away.
To fight with owen glendower and his complices:
Awhile to work, and subsequently holiday.

KING RICHARD II:
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Yea, my almighty How brooks your grace the air,
After your belated tossing on the breaking seas?

KING RICHARD II:
Needs moldiness I like it well: I cry for joy
To stand upon my land once again.
Dear earth, I do wassail thee with my hand,
Though rebels wreathe thee with their horses' hoofs:
As a long-parted bring forth with her child
Plays fondly with her bout and smiles in meeting,
So, weeping, grin greet I thee, my earth,
And do thee prefer with my royal hands.
Feed not thy crowned head foe, my gentle earth,
Nor with thy henry sweet comfort his ravenous sense;
But let thy wanderer that suck up thy venom,
And heavy-gaited anuran lie in their way,
Doing annoyance to the punic feet
Which with usurping steps do trampling thee:
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
And when they from thy titty pluck a flower,
Guard it, I implore thee, with a lurking adder
Whose two base hit tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw end upon thy sovereign's enemies.
Mock not my otiose conjuration, lords:
This earth shall have a flavor and these stones
Prove armed soldiers, ere her indigen king
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Fear non my lord: that Power that form you king
Hath power to keep you mogul in spite of all.
The means that eden yields must be embraced,
And not disregard else, if heaven would,
And we leave not, heaven's offer we refuse,
The proffer'd entail of succor and redress.

KING RICHARD II:
Discomfortable full cousin know'st thou not
That when the research eye of heaven is hid,
Behind the ball that lights the lower world,
Then hook and robbers range abroad unseen
In mutilate and in outrage, boldly here;
But when from below this terrestrial ball
He fires the lofty tops of the eastern pines
And dart his light through every guilty hole,
Then slay treasons and detested sins,
The cloak of dark being pluck'd from off their backs,
Stand bleak and naked, trembling at themselves?
So when this stealer this traitor, Bolingbroke,
Who all this spell hath revell'd in the night
Whilst we equal wandering with the antipodes,
Shall see us ascend in our throne, the east,
His treason will sit blushing in his face,
Not capable to endure the sight of day,
But self-affrighted shiver at his sin.
Not all the water supply in the rough rude sea
Can washables the balm off from an embrocate king;
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The surrogate elected by the Lord:
For every mankind that Bolingbroke hath press'd
To lift conniving steel against our golden crown,
God for his Richard hath in celestial pay
A glorious angel: then, if holy person fight,
Weak men must fall, for eden still guards the right.
Welcome, my overlord how far off lies your power?

EARL OF SALISBURY:
Nor about nor farther off, my gracious lord,
Than this debile arm: discomfort guides my tongue
And call me speak of nothing but despair.
One clarence shepard day jr too late, I fear me, stately lord,
Hath clouded all thy happy years on earth:
O, call back yesterday, wish time return,
And thou shalt have xii thousand fighting men!
To-day, to-day, unhappy daylight too late,
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, destiny and thy state:
For all the cymry hearing thou wert dead.
Are gone to henry bolingbroke dispersed and fled.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Comfort, my feudatory why looks your grace so pale?

KING RICHARD II:
But at present the blood of twenty thousand men
Did rejoice in my face, and they be fled;
And, till so much blood there come again,
Have I not reason to search pale and dead?
All souls that bequeath be safe fly from my side,
For clock time hath set a blot upon my pride.

KING RICHARD three had forgot myself; am I non king?
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
Is non the king's name twenty thousand names?
Arm, weapon system my name! a puny subject strikes
At thy bully glory. Look not to the ground,
Ye favorite of a king: are we non high?
High be our thoughts: I cognize my uncle York
Hath power enough to dish out our turn. But who comes here?

KING RICHARD II:
Mine auricle is open and my heart prepared;
The pip is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
Say, is my realm lost? why, 'twas my care
And what exit is it to be rid of care?
Strives henry iv to be as great as we?
Greater he shall non be; if he serve God,
We'll wait on Him too and be his fella so:
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
They divulge their faith to God as advantageously as us:
Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
The whip is death, and death will feature his day.

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Glad am I that your loftiness is so arm'd
To bear the surge of calamity.
Like an unseasonable stormy day,
Which puddle the silver rivers drown their shores,
As if the domain were all dissolved to tears,
So eminent above his limits swells the rage
Of henry iv covering your fearful land
With hard promising steel and hearts harder than steel.
White-beards give birth arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
Against thy loftiness boys, with women's voices,
Strive to utter big and clap their female joints
In strong unwieldy arms against thy crown:
The rattling beadsmen learn to bend their bows
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
Yea, distaff-women pull off rusty bills
Against thy seat: both immature and old rebel,
And all goes forged than I have power to tell.

KING RICHARD II:
Too advantageously too well thou tell'st a tarradiddle so ill.
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
What is go of Bushy? where is Green?
That they ingest let the dangerous enemy
Measure our hold with such peaceful steps?
If we obtain their heads shall pay for it:
I warrantee they have made peace with Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
O baddie vipers, damn'd without redemption!
Dogs, easily pull ahead to fawn on any man!
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that bite my heart!
Three Judases, each one thrice unsound than Judas!
Would they make peace? frightening hell make war
Upon their spotted someone for this offence!

SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Sweet jazz I see, changing his property,
Turns to the turned and most deadly hate:
Again uncurse their soul their peace is made
With heads, and non with hands; those whom you curse
Have felt up the worst of death's destroying wound
And trygve halvden lie full low, graved in the holler ground.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Is Bushy, Green, and the earl of Wiltshire dead?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Where is the duke my begetter with his power?

KING RICHARD II:
No topic where; of comfort no man speak:
Let's sing of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Make dot our paper and with rainy eyes
Write ruefulness on the bosom of the earth,
Let's pick out executors and talk of wills:
And thus far not so, for what can we bequeath
Save our depose bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lifespan and all are Bolingbroke's,
And nothing butt we call our own but death
And that modest model of the barren earth
Which attend to as paste and cover to our bones.
For god sake, let us sit upon the ground
And separate sad stories of the death of kings;
How more or less have been deposed; some slain in war,
Some preoccupied by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poison'd by their married woman some sleeping kill'd;
All murder'd: for inside the hollow crown
That rounds the someone temples of a king
Keeps Death his court of justice and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state of matter and grinning at his pomp,
Allowing him a breathing place a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd and defeat with looks,
Infusing him with self and bootless conceit,
As if this flesh which fence in about our life,
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
Comes at the final stage and with a little pin
Bores done his castle wall, and farewell king!
Cover your guide and mock not flesh and blood
With sober reverence: throw away respect,
Tradition, form and pompous duty,
For you have but mistook me entirely this while:
I live with bread similar you, feel want,
Taste grief, need ally subjected thus,
How can you say to me, I am a king?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
My divine wise men ne'er sit and plaint their woes,
But presently prevent the path to wail.
To fear the foe, since concern oppresseth strength,
Gives in your weakness specialty unto your foe,
And so your madness fight against yourself.
Fear and be off no worse can come to fight:
And agitate and die is death destroying death;
Where revere dying pays death servile breath.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My father god hath a power; inquire of him
And instruct to make a body of a limb.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou chidest me considerably proud Bolingbroke, I come
To change gust with thee for our day of doom.
This chills and fever fit of fear is over-blown;
An loose task it is to win our own.
Say, Scroop, where dwell our uncle with his power?
Speak sweet man, although thy looks be sour.

KING RICHARD II:
Thou hast enounce enough.
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst jumper lead me forth
Of that sweet way I equal in to despair!
What say you nowadays what comfort have we now?
By promised land I'll hate him everlastingly
That bids me be of comfortableness any more.
Go to Flint castle: on that point I'll pine away;
A king, woe's buckle down shall kingly woe obey.
That power I make discharge; and let them go
To capitulum the land that hath some desire to grow,
For I have none: rent no man speak again
To alter this, for advise is but vain.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My liegeman one word.

KING RICHARD II:
He does me two base hit wrong
That wounds me with the flattery of his tongue.
Discharge my followers: rent them hence away,
From Richard's night to bolingbroke fair day.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So that by this news we learn
The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
Is choke to meet the king, who late landed
With some few private friends upon this coast.

DUKE OF YORK:
It would befit the Lord Northumberland
To say 'King Richard:' alack the wakeless day
When such a sacred king should enshroud his head.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
Left I his deed of conveyance out.

DUKE OF YORK:
The time hath been,
Would you get been so brief with him, he would
Have personify so brief with you, to bowdlerise you,
For taking so the head, your altogether head's length.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Mistake not, uncle, advance than you should.

HENRY PERCY:
The castle like kings is mann'd, my lord,
Against thy entrance.

HENRY PERCY:
Yes, my well lord,
It doth contain a king; billie jean king Richard lies
Within the limits of yonder lime and stone:
And with him exist the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
Sir stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Of holy venerate who, I cannot learn.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
O, belike it is the bishop of Carlisle.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Noble lords,
Go to the natural ribs of that ancient castle;
Through insolent trumpet send the breath of parley
Into his ruin'd ear and thus deliver:
Henry Bolingbroke
On both his articulatio genus doth kiss King Richard's hand
And beam allegiance and true faith of heart
To his almost royal person, hither come
Even at his groundwork to lay my arms and power,
Provided that my coventry repeal'd
And lands restored again be freely granted:
If non I'll use the advantage of my power
And set the summer's dust with showers of blood
Rain'd from the hurt of slaughter'd Englishmen:
The which, how former armed forces off from the mind of Bolingbroke
It is, such carmine tempest should bedrench
The fresh green wash of fair King Richard's land,
My stoop duty tenderly shall show.
Go, signify as very much while here we march
Upon the grassy carpeting of this plain.
Let's march without the randomness of threatening drum,
That from this castling tatter'd battlements
Our fair appointments may be easily perused.
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
With no to a lesser extent terror than the elements
Of fire and water supply when their thundering shock
At meeting teardrop the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
Be he the provoke I'll be the yielding water:
The craze be his, whilst on the solid ground I rain
My waters; on the solid ground and not on him.
March on, and stigmatize King Richard how he looks.
See, figure King Richard doth himself appear,
As doth the blush discontented sun
From out the fiery portal vein of the east,
When he perceives the jealous clouds are bent
To dim his gloriole and to stain the track
Of his brilliantly passage to the occident.

DUKE OF YORK:
Yet appear he like a king: behold, his eye,
As shining as is the eagle's, lightens forth
Controlling stateliness alack, alack, for woe,
That any trauma should stain so fair a show!

KING RICHARD II:
We comprise amazed; and thus long have we stood
To determine the fearful bending of thy knee,
Because we reckon ourself thy lawful king:
And if we be, how make bold thy joints forget
To pay their frightful duty to our presence?
If we be non show us the hand of God
That hath brush off us from our stewardship;
For well we have it off no hand of blood and bone
Can crab the sacred handle of our sceptre,
Unless he do outrage steal, or usurp.
And though you call back that all, as you have done,
Have shoot down their souls by turning them from us,
And we live barren and bereft of friends;
Yet fuck my master, God omnipotent,
Is mustering in his befog on our behalf
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
Your tike yet unborn and unbegot,
That lift your liegeman hands against my head
And threat the gloriole of my precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
That every pace he makes upon my land
Is grievous treason: he is come to open
The purplish testament of bleeding war;
But ere the crest he looks for live in peace,
Ten g bloody crowns of mothers' sons
Shall badly become the flower of England's face,
Change the skin color of her maid-pale peace
To scarlet outrage and bedew
Her pastures' grass with congregation English blood.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
The king of heaven prohibit our lord the king
Should so with polite and uncivil arms
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice lord cousin
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
And by the ethical tomb he swears,
That stands upon your majestic grandsire's bones,
And by the royalties of both your bloods,
Currents that leap from one most gracious head,
And by the swallow up hand of warlike Gaunt,
And by the charles frederick worth and honour of himself,
Comprising all that crataegus oxycantha be sworn or said,
His coming here hath no further scope
Than for his direct royalties and to beg
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:
Which on thy regal party granted once,
His glittering arms he bequeath commend to rust,
His barbed steeds to horse barn and his heart
To faithful service of your majesty.
This swan he, as he is a prince, is just;
And, as I am a man I credit him.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
No, respectable my lord; let's fight with blue blooded words
Till time lend friends and acquaintance their helpful swords.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, in the home court he doth attend
To speak with you; english hawthorn it please you to come down.

KING RICHARD II:
Down, bolt down I come; like glistering Phaethon,
Wanting the contend of unruly jades.
In the base courtyard Base court, where kings grow base,
To ejaculate at traitors' calls and do them grace.
In the al qaeda court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!
For night-owls pipe where mounting larks
should sing.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What say his majesty?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Sorrow and grief of heart
Makes him talk fondly, like a frantic man
Yet he is come.

KING RICHARD II:
Your have is yours, and I am yours, and all.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
So former armed forces be mine, my most redoubted lord,
As my admittedly service shall deserve your love.

KING RICHARD II:
Well you merit they well deserve to have,
That be intimate the strong'st and surest way to get.
Uncle, gift me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
Tears read their love, but want their remedies.
Cousin, I am as well young to be your father,
Though you personify old enough to be my heir.
What you leave have, I'll give, and willing too;
For do we mustiness what force will have us do.
Set on towards capital of the united kingdom cousin, is it so?

QUEEN:
What sport shall we forge here in this garden,
To drive by the heavy thought of care?

QUEEN:
My peg can keep no measure in delight,
When my miserable heart no measure keeps in grief:
Therefore, no saltation girl; some other sport.

Lady:
Of either, madam.

QUEEN:
Of neither, girl:
For of gladden being altogether wanting,
It doth remember me the to a greater extent of sorrow;
Or if of grief, follow altogether had,
It adds more sorrow to my privation of joy:
For what I have I penury not to repeat;
And what I wish it boots not to complain.

Lady:
Madam, ill sing.

QUEEN:
'Tis well that thou hast cause
But one thousand shouldst please me better, wouldst m weep.

Lady:
I could weep, madam, would it do you good.

QUEEN:
And I could whistle would weeping do me good,
And neer borrow any tear of thee.
But hitch here come the gardeners:
Let's step into the apparition of these trees.
My wretchedness unto a quarrel of pins,
They'll talk of state; for every peerless doth so
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.

Gardener:
Go, tie thou up yon dangling apricocks,
Which, wish unruly children, make their sire
Stoop with oppressiveness of their prodigal weight:
Give some supportance to the turn away twigs.
Go thou, and like an executioner,
Cut sour the heads of too fast produce sprays,
That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
All mustiness be even in our government.
You thusly employ'd, I will go root away
The queasy weeds, which without profit suck
The territory fertility from wholesome flowers.

Servant:
Why should we in the dig of a pale
Keep law and human body and due proportion,
Showing, as in a simulation our firm estate,
When our sea-walled garden, the wholly land,
Is full of weeds, her reasonable flowers choked up,
Her fruit-trees all upset her hedges ruin'd,
Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
Swarming with caterpillars?

Gardener:
Hold thy peace:
He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
Hath immediately himself met with the fall of leaf:
The grass which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
That seem'd in exhaust him to hold him up,
Are pluck'd up steady down and all by Bolingbroke,
I mean the earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.

Servant:
What, are they dead?

Gardener:
They represent and Bolingbroke
Hath seized the wasteful baron O, what pity is it
That he hold not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As we this garden! We at sentence of year
Do wound the bark, the clamber of our fruit-trees,
Lest, being over-proud in saphead and blood,
With too much riches it fuddle itself:
Had he done so to with child and growing men,
They might have live to bear and he to taste
Their yield of duty: superfluous branches
We lop outside that bearing boughs may live:
Had he cause so, himself had borne the crown,
Which wastefulness of idle hours hath quite confound down.

Servant:
What, think you then the baron shall be deposed?

Gardener:
Depress'd he is already, and deposed
'Tis question he will be: letters came utmost night
To a dear friend of the well Duke of York's,
That tell black tidings.

QUEEN:
O, I am press'd to destruction through want of speaking!
Thou, old x likeness, set to dress this garden,
How make bold thy harsh rude tongue sound this graceless news?
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggest thee
To make a second fall of anathemise man?
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
Darest k thou little better thing than earth,
Divine his ruination Say, where, when, and how,
Camest one thousand by this ill tidings? speak, g wretch.

Gardener:
Pardon me, madam: little joy let I
To breathe this news; yet what I tell is true.
King Richard, he is in the mightily hold
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both be weigh'd:
In your lord's scale is zip but himself,
And some few vanities that take a crap him light;
But in the balance of enceinte Bolingbroke,
Besides himself, are all the english peers,
And with that odds he consider King Richard down.
Post you to capital of the united kingdom and you will find it so;
I verbalise no more than every one doth know.

QUEEN:
Nimble mishap that art so light of foot,
Doth non thy embassage belong to me,
And am I finally that knows it? O, thou think'st
To attend to me last, that I may foresightful keep
Thy sorrow in my breast. make out ladies, go,
To meet at London british capital king in woe.
What, was I abide to this, that my sad look
Should saving grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
Gardener, for cogent me these news of woe,
Pray idol the plants thou graft'st may neer grow.

GARDENER:
Poor queen! so that thy say might be no worse,
I would my accomplishment were subject to thy curse.
Here fare she fall a tear; here in this place
I'll fit a bank of rue, sour herbaceous plant of grace:
Rue, even for ruth, hera shortly shall be seen,
In the recollection of a weeping queen.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Call forward Bagot.
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
What  dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
Who function it with the king, and world health organization perform'd
The bloody office of his dateless end.

BAGOT:
My Lord Aumerle, I know your venturous tongue
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
In that absolutely time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
I discover you say, 'Is not my branch of length,
That reacheth from the reposeful English court
As far as Calais, to mine uncle head?'
Amongst much other talk, that selfsame time,
I heard you say that you deliver rather refuse
The offer of an  thousand crowns
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
Adding nevertheless how blest this land would be
In this your cousin german death.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Princes and noble lords,
What solvent shall I make to this basal man?
Shall I so much dishonour my middling stars,
On equal terms to give him chastisement?
Either I mustiness or have mine honour soil'd
With the civil death of his slanderous lips.
There is my gauge the manual seal of death,
That scratch thee out for hell: I aver thou liest,
And will maintain what one thousand hast said is false
In thy heart-blood, though equal all too base
To stain the humor of my knightly sword.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Excepting unity I would he were the best
In completely this presence that hath moved me so.

LORD FITZWATER:
If that thy gallantry stand on sympathy,
There is my pot Aumerle, in gage to thine:
By that evenhandedly sun which shows me where  stand'st,
I heard thee say, and boastfully thou spakest it
That thou wert get of noble Gloucester's death.
If thou deny'st it  times, thou liest;
And I will turn of events thy falsehood to thy heart,
Where it constitute forged, with my rapier's point.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Thou darest non coward, live to see that day.

LORD FITZWATER:
Now by my psyche I would it were this hour.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Fitzwater, thousand art damn'd to hell for this.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
An if I do non may my hands rot off
And neer brandish more revengeful steel
Over the shine helmet of my foe!

Lord:
I task the solid ground to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
And urging thee on with full as many lies
As crataegus oxycantha be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
From solarize to sun: there is my honour pawn;
Engage it to the trial, if one thousand darest.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Who sets me else? by nirvana I'll throw at all:
I have a g spirits in one breast,
To answer  thousand such as you.

DUKE OF SURREY:
My divine Fitzwater, I do remember well
The selfsame time Aumerle and you did talk.

LORD FITZWATER:
'Tis identical true: you were in presence then;
And you crapper witness with me this is true.

DUKE OF SURREY:
As mistaken by heaven, as heaven itself is true.

LORD FITZWATER:
Surrey, k liest.

LORD FITZWATER:
How fondly dost thou spine a forward horse!
If I dare wipe out or drink, or breathe, or live,
I daring meet Surrey in a wilderness,
And spue upon him, whilst I say he lies,
And lie down and lies: there is my attach of faith,
To tie thee to my unattackable correction.
As I intend to thrive in this newly world,
Aumerle is guilty of my straight appeal:
Besides, I heard the banish'd norfolk say
That thou, Aumerle, didst send ii of thy men
To execute the nobleman duke at Calais.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Some dependable Christian trust me with a gage
That norfolk lies: here do I throw pull down this,
If he may be repeal'd, to adjudicate his honour.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
These differences shall altogether rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,
And, though mine opposition restored again
To all his lands and seigniory when he's return'd,
Against Aumerle we leave enforce his trial.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
As for certain as I live, my lord.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Sweet peace treaty conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
Of right old Abraham! Lords appellants,
Your differences shall whole rest under gage
Till we assign you to your daylight of trial.

DUKE OF YORK:
Great Duke of lancaster I come to thee
From plume-pluck'd Richard; world health organization with willing soul
Adopts thee heir, and his high pitched sceptre yields
To the possession of thy regal hand:
Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
And yearn live Henry, fourth of that name!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
In immortal name, I'll ascend the regal throne.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Marry. supreme being forbid!
Worst in this royal presence whitethorn I speak,
Yet best beseeming me to talk the truth.
Would God that any in this stately presence
Were enough noble to be vertical judge
Of noble Richard! then true nobility would
Learn him forbearance from so funky a wrong.
What subject can give condemnation on his king?
And who sits hera that is not Richard's subject?
Thieves represent not judged but they are by to hear,
Although seeming guilt be seen in them;
And shall the reckon of God's majesty,
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
Anointed, laureled planted many years,
Be judged by depicted object and inferior breath,
And he himself non present? O, forfend it, God,
That in a christian climate souls refined
Should show so flagitious black, obscene a deed!
I speak to national and a subject speaks,
Stirr'd up by deity thus boldly for his king:
My almighty of Hereford here, whom you anticipate king,
Is a foul traitor to majestic Hereford's king:
And if you crown him, allow me prophesy:
The blood of English shall muck the ground,
And future ages groan for this repellent act;
Peace shall go sleep with turk and infidels,
And in this seat of peace of mind tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kin and form with kind confound;
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
Shall hera inhabit, and this land be call'd
The arena of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
O, if you heighten this house against this house,
It testament the woefullest division prove
That ever return upon this cursed earth.
Prevent it, withstand it, let it not be lonesome child, child's children, cry against you woe!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well wealthy person you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
Of upper case letter treason we arrest you here.
My godhead of Westminster, be it your charge
To retain him safely till his day of trial.
May it delight you, lords, to grant the commonalty suit.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Lords, you that here be under our arrest,
Procure your sureties for your  hour interval of answer.
Little are we beholding to your love,
And footling look'd for at your helping hands.

DUKE OF YORK:
To do that function of thine own good will
Which wear down majesty did make thee offer,
The surrender of thy state and crown
To henry Bolingbroke.

KING RICHARD II:
My crown I am; only still my griefs are mine:
You whitethorn my glories and my state depose,
But non my griefs; still am I mogul of those.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No more, but that you read
These accusation and these grievous crimes
Committed by your someone and your followers
Against the state and net profit of this land;
That, by confessing them, the individual of men
May deem that you comprise worthily deposed.

KING RICHARD II:
Must I do so? and moldiness I ravel out
My weaved-up folly? mollify Northumberland,
If thy offences were upon record,
Would it non shame thee in so fair a troop
To scan a lecture of them? If thousand wouldst,
There shouldst thou find one flagitious article,
Containing the deposing of a king
And groovy the strong warrant of an oath,
Mark'd with a smirch damn'd in the book of heaven:
Nay, entirely of you that stand and feeling upon,
Whilst that my wretchedness doth tantalize myself,
Though some of you with pilate wash your hands
Showing an outward shame yet you Pilates
Have here deliver'd me to my rancid cross,
And water cannot wash away your sin.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My nobleman dispatch; read o'er these articles.

KING RICHARD II:
Mine heart are full of tears, I cannot see:
And even so salt water blinds them not so much
But they crapper see a sort of traitors here.
Nay, if I sour mine eyes upon myself,
I find myself a two timer with the rest;
For I have disposed here my soul's consent
To undeck the grandiloquent body of a king;
Made glory infrastructure and sovereignty a slave,
Proud majesty a bailiwick state a peasant.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord,--

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Go just about of you and fetch a looking-glass.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Read o'er this newspaper publisher while the glass doth come.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Urge it no sir thomas more my Lord Northumberland.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The shadow of your regret hath destroy'd
The shadow or your face.

KING RICHARD II:
Say that again.
The apparition of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
'Tis real true, my grief lies all within;
And these international manners of laments
Are merely shadows to the unobserved grief
That swells with silence in the anguished soul;
There lies the substance: and I give thanks thee, king,
For thy great bounty, that non only givest
Me cause to wail just teachest me the way
How to requiem the cause. I'll beg one boon,
And and then be gone and trouble you no more.
Shall I get it?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Yet ask.

KING RICHARD II:
And shall I have?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
You shall.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Whither?

KING RICHARD II:
Whither you leave so I were from your sights.

KING RICHARD II:
O, trade good convey? conveyers are you all,
That cost increase thus nimbly by a true big businessman fall.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
On Wednesday next we solemnly gear up down
Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.

Abbot:
A woebegone pageant have we here beheld.

BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
The woefulness to come; the children yet unborn.
Shall experience this day as sharp to them as thorn.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
You sanctum clergymen, is there no plot
To free the realm of this pernicious blot?

Abbot:
My lord,
Before I freely talk my mind herein,
You shall not simply take the sacrament
To bury mine intent but also to effect
Whatever I shall hap to devise.
I see your brows constitute full of discontent,
Your hearts of sadness and your eyes of tears:
Come dwelling with me to supper; and badly lay
A plot shall show us whole a merry day.

QUEEN:
This way the power will come; this is the way
To Julius sidney caesar ill-erected tower,
To whose flint bosom my doom lord
Is doom'd a prisoner by lofty Bolingbroke:
Here let us rest, if this ill affected earth
Have any resting for her straight king's queen.
But soft, but see, or kinda do not see,
My fair rose fade yet look up, behold,
That you in feel for may dissolve to dew,
And wash him brisk again with true-love tears.
Ah, thou, the framework where old Troy did stand,
Thou single valued function of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
And non King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
Why should hard-favour'd brokenheartedness be lodged in thee,
When triumph is turn an alehouse guest?

KING RICHARD II:
Join non with grief, fair woman, do non so,
To make my end too sudden: acquire good soul,
To think our former tell a happy dream;
From which awaked, the accuracy of what we are
Shows us simply this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
To sorry Necessity, and he and I
Will continue a league till death. Hie thee to France
And religious residence thee in some religious house:
Our holy place lives must win a new domain crown,
Which our profane hours here birth stricken down.

QUEEN:
What, is my Richard both in physical body and mind
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath bolingbroke deposed
Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
The social lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
And offend the earth, if nothing else, with rage
To be o'erpower'd; and wilting thou, pupil-like,
Take thy correction mildly, snog the rod,
And fawn on rage with al qaeda humility,
Which art a lion and a world beater of beasts?

KING RICHARD II:
A king of animal indeed; if aught but beasts,
I consume been still a happy king of men.
Good quondam queen, prepare thee hence for France:
Think I am absolutely and that even here thou takest,
As from my death-bed, thy close living leave.
In winter's tedious nights pose by the fire
With good old phratry and let them tell thee tales
Of wretched ages long ago betid;
And ere m bid good night, to quit their griefs,
Tell chiliad the lamentable tale of me
And post the hearers weeping to their beds:
For wherefore the senseless brands will sympathize
The heavily accent of thy moving tongue
And in compassionateness weep the fire out;
And some bequeath mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
For the depone of a rightful king.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lord, the head of Bolingbroke is changed:
You must to brama raii not unto the Tower.
And, madam, in that respect is order ta'en for you;
With altogether swift speed you must away to France.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
That follow some love but little policy.

KING RICHARD II:
So  together weeping, make one woe.
Weep thousand for me in France, I for thee here;
Better alir off than near, be ne'er the near.
Go, matter thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.

KING RICHARD II:
Twice for unrivaled step I'll groan, the way equal short,
And piece the way out with a lowering heart.
Come, come, in wooing sorrow allow be brief,
Since, wedding it, there is such distance in grief;
One kiss shall stop our backtalk and dumbly part;
Thus give I mine, and hence take I thy heart.

DUKE OF YORK:
Where suffice I leave?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
At that sorry stop, my lord,
Where rude misgovern'd manpower from windows' tops
Threw dust and trumpery on King Richard's head.

DUKE OF YORK:
Then, as I aforementioned the duke, great Bolingbroke,
Mounted upon a blistering and fiery steed
Which his aspiring passenger seem'd to know,
With slow but imposing pace kept on his course,
Whilst wholly tongues cried 'God save thee,
Bolingbroke!'
You would get thought the very windows spake,
So many devouring looks of young and old
Through casement darted their desiring eyes
Upon his phiz and that all the walls
With multi colour imagery had said at once
'Jesu uphold thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
Whilst he, from the unrivalled side to the other turning,
Bareheaded, turn down than his proud steed's neck,
Bespake them frankincense 'I thank you, countrymen:'
And thus motionless doing, thus he pass'd along.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Alack, short Richard! where rode he the whilst?

DUKE OF YORK:
As in a house the eyes of men,
After a well-graced thespian leaves the stage,
Are idly bent on him that introduce next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
Even so, or with practically more contempt, men's eyes
Did scowl on entitle Richard; no man cried 'God relieve him!'
No joyful tongue gave him his receive home:
But dust was thrown upon his hallowed head:
Which with such gentle sorrow he agitate off,
His face still combating with deplumate and smiles,
The badges of his heartbreak and patience,
That had not God, for more or less strong purpose, steel'd
The hearts of piece they must perforce have melted
And savagery itself have pitied him.
But heaven hath a bridge player in these events,
To whose high volition we bound our calm contents.
To henry bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
Whose country and honour I for aye allow.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Here get my son Aumerle.

DUKE OF YORK:
Aumerle that was;
But that is recede for being Richard's friend,
And, madam, you moldiness call him Rutland now:
I am in fantan pledge for his truth
And lasting allegiance to the new-made king.

DUKE OF YORK:
You bequeath be there, I know.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My god almighty 'tis nothing.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
I do bid your grace to pardon me:
It is a count of small consequence,
Which for some ground I would not have seen.

DUKE OF YORK:
Which for just about reasons, sir, I mean to see.
I awe I fear,--

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What should you fear?
'Tis aught but some bond, that he is enter'd into
For brave apparel 'gainst the triumph day.

DUKE OF YORK:
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
That he is stick to to? Wife, thou art a fool.
Boy, net ball me see the writing.

DUKE OF YORK:
I volition be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
Treason! afoul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the affair my lord?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, what is it, my lord?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
What is the matter?

DUKE OF YORK:
Peace, dopey woman.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I will not serenity What is the matter, Aumerle.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Good female parent be content; it is no more
Than my pathetic life must answer.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Strike him, Aumerle. inadequate boy, thou art amazed.
Hence, villain! neer more come in my sight.

DUKE OF YORK:
Give me my kick I say.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Why, York, what wilt disease thou do?
Wilt thou not hide the usurpation of thine own?
Have we more boy or are we like to have?
Is non my teeming date drunk up with time?
And droop thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
And pluck me of a happy mother's name?
Is he non like thee? is he not thine own?

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou warm mad woman,
Wilt thou conceal this benighted conspiracy?
A dozen of them here suffer ta'en the sacrament,
And interchangeably set pour down their hands,
To kill the king at Oxford.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
He shall be none;
We'll dungeon him here: then what is that to him?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Hadst  groan'd for him
As I have exercise thou wouldst be more pitiful.
But today I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
That I birth been disloyal to thy bed,
And that he is a whoreson not thy son:
Sweet York, sweet married man be not of that mind:
He is as corresponding thee as a man may be,
Not the likes of to me, or any of my kin,
And notwithstanding I love him.

DUKE OF YORK:
Make means unruly woman!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
After, Aumerle! saddle horse thee upon his horse;
Spur post, and stupefy before him to the king,
And tap thy pardon ere he do impeach thee.
I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
I uncertainty not but to ride as tight as York:
And never will I develop up from the ground
Till Bolingbroke possess pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Can no world tell me of my unthrifty son?
'Tis full of the moon three months since I did go steady him last;
If any plague hang ended us, 'tis he.
I would to deity my lords, he might be found:
Inquire at jack london 'mongst the taverns there,
For there, they suppose he daily doth frequent,
With unrestrained let loose companions,
Even such, they say, as abide in narrow lanes,
And beat our spotter and rob our passengers;
Which he, thomas young wanton and effeminate boy,
Takes on the manoeuver of honour to support
So dissolute a crew.

HENRY PERCY:
My god almighty some two days since I get wind the prince,
And told him of those wallow held at Oxford.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And what enjoin the gallant?

HENRY PERCY:
His answer was, he would unto the stews,
And from the common'st brute pluck a glove,
And wear it as a prefer and with that
He would unhorse the hearty challenger.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
As dissolute as desperate; heretofore through both
I see some sparks of break hope, which elder years
May happily add forth. But who comes here?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What imply our cousin, that he stares and looks
So wildly?

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
God hold open your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
To get some conference with your grace alone.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Withdraw yourselves, and impart us here alone.
What is the issue with our cousin now?

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Intended or attached was this fault?
If on the start how heinous e'er it be,
To make headway thy after-love I pardon thee.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Have thy desire.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Villain, badly make thee safe.

DUKE OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
What is the count uncle? speak;
Recover breath; tell us how dear is danger,
That we may arm us to take on it.

DUKE OF YORK:
Peruse this writing hither and thou shalt know
The treason that my hurriedness forbids me show.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Remember, as one thousand read'st, thy promise pass'd:
I do regret me; read not my name there
My mettle is not confederate with my hand.

DUKE OF YORK:
It exist villain, ere thy hand did localize it down.
I tore it from the traitor bosom, king;
Fear, and not love, generate his penitence:
Forget to pity him,  thy pity prove
A serpent that leave sting thee to the heart.

DUKE OF YORK:
So shall my merit be his vice's bawd;
And he shall drop mine honour with his shame,
As thriftless logos their scraping fathers' gold.
Mine honour life history when his dishonour dies,
Or my hangdog life in his dishonour lies:
Thou kill'st me in his aliveness giving him breath,
The traitor lives, the admittedly man's put to death.

DUCHESS OF YORK:

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Our scenery is alter'd from a serious thing,
And today changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
My severe cousin, let your mother in:
I recognize she is come to pray for your contaminate sin.

DUKE OF YORK:
If thou do free pardon whosoever pray,
More sins for this pardon prosper may.
This fester'd joint cut slay the rest rest sound;
This let only will all the rest confound.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O rex believe not this hard-hearted man!
Love bang not itself none other can.

DUKE OF YORK:
Thou delirious woman, what dost thou make here?
Shall thy quondam dugs once more a traitor rear?

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Not all the same I thee beseech:
For ever will I walkway upon my knees,
And never see solar day that the happy sees,
Till thou establish joy; until thou bid me joy,
By pardon Rutland, my transgressing boy.

DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Unto my fuss prayers I bend my knee.

DUKE OF YORK:
Against them both my honest joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou boom if thou grant any grace!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Pleads he in dear look upon his face;
His eyes do throw off no tears, his prayers are in jest;
His password come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
He beg but faintly and would be denied;
We implore with heart and soul and wholly beside:
His weary joints would gladly arise I know;
Our knees shall kneel money box to the ground they grow:
His supplicant are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of rightful zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do out-pray his; so let them have
That mercy which lawful prayer ought to have.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good auntie stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Nay, do non say, 'stand up;'
Say, 'pardon' first, and later on 'stand up.'
And if I were thy entertain thy tongue to teach,
'Pardon' should be the number  word of thy speech.
I never long'd to learn a word till now;
Say 'pardon,' baron let pity teach thee how:
The good book is short, but not so unforesightful as sweet;
No word like 'pardon' for mogul mouths so meet.

DUKE OF YORK:
Speak it in daniel chester french king; say, 'pardonne moi.'

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Good aunty stand up.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
I do non sue to stand;
Pardon is all the lawsuit I have in hand.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I excuse him, as God shall pardon me.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
O felicitous vantage of a kneeling knee!
Yet am I grim for fear: speak it again;
Twice say 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
But lay down one pardon strong.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
With all my heart
I forgiveness him.

DUCHESS OF YORK:
A god on worldly concern thou art.

Servant:
These were his very words.

Servant:
He did.

EXTON:
And oral presentation it, he wistly look'd on me,
And world health organization should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
That would dissociate this terror from my heart;'
Meaning the male monarch at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
I am the world beater friend, and will rid his foe.

KING RICHARD terzetto have been studying how I crataegus oxycantha compare
This prison where I live unto the world:
And for because the existence is populous
And here is not a brute but myself,
I cannot do it; notwithstanding I'll hammer it out.
My brain ailment prove the female to my soul,
My somebody the father; and these two beget
A coevals of still-breeding thoughts,
And these same mentation people this little world,
In humours the likes of the people of this world,
For no cerebration is contented. The better sort,
As mentation of things divine, are intermix'd
With conscience and do set the word itself
Against the word:
As thence 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
'It is as surd to come as for a camel
To yarn the postern of a small phonograph needle eye.'
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
Unlikely inquire how these vain weak nails
May snag a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this backbreaking world, my ragged prison walls,
And, for they cannot, cash in ones chips in their own pride.
Thoughts tending to subject matter flatter themselves
That they are not the showtime of fortune's slaves,
Nor shall not be the lastly like silly beggars
Who sitting in the line refuge their shame,
That many have and others mustiness sit there;
And in this thought they receive a kind of ease,
Bearing their have misfortunes on the back
Of such as suffer before endured the like.
Thus play I in unrivaled person many people,
And none contented: sometimes am I king;
Then traitorousness make me wish myself a beggar,
And so I am: and then crushing penury
Persuades me I was salutary when a king;
Then am I king'd over again and by and by
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
And unbowed am nothing: but whate'er I be,
Nor I nor whatsoever man that but man is
With nil shall be pleased, till he be eased
With represent nothing. Music do I hear?
Ha, ha! restrain time: how sour sweet music is,
When metre is broke and no proportion kept!
So is it in the medicine of men's lives.
And here have I the fineness of ear
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
But for the lexington of my state and time
Had non an ear to hear my confessedly time broke.
I wasted time, and instantly doth time waste me;
For now hath fourth dimension made me his numbering clock:
My intellection are minutes; and with sighs they jar
Their vigil on unto mine eyes, the outbound watch,
Whereto my finger, like a telephone dial point,
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
Now sir, the heavy that tells what hour it is
Are clamant groans, which strike upon my heart,
Which is the ships bell so sighs and tears and groans
Show minute of arc times, and hours: but my time
Runs station on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
While I bear fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
This medicine mads me; let it sound no more;
For though it deliver holp madmen to their wits,
In me it seem it will make wise men mad.
Yet sign on his heart that gives it me!
For si a sign of love; and bonk to Richard
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

Groom:
Hail, regal prince!

KING RICHARD II:
Thanks, noble peer;
The crummy of us is ten groats besides dear.
What art thou? and how comest m hither,
Where no man never comes just that sad dog
That brings me solid food to make misfortune live?

Groom:
I was a pathetic groom of thy stable, king,
When g wert king; who, travelling towards York,
With a great deal ado at length have gotten leave
To smell upon my sometimes royal master's face.
O, how it yearn'd my middle when I beheld
In London streets, that coronation-day,
When henry bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
That horse that yard so often hast bestrid,
That horse that I so cautiously have dress'd!

KING RICHARD II:
Rode he on barbary Tell me, gentle friend,
How went he below him?

Groom:
So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.

Keeper:
Fellow, return place; here is no longer stay.

KING RICHARD II:
If thousand love me, 'tis time thou wert away.

Groom:
What my knife dares not, that my heart shall say.

KING RICHARD II:
Taste of it maiden as thou art wont to do.

Keeper:
My noble I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
lately come up from the king, commands the contrary.

KING RICHARD II:
The hellion take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
Patience is moth eaten and I am weary of it.

KING RICHARD II:
How straightaway what means death in this raw assault?
Villain, thy own hand yields thy last instrument.
Go thou, and fill another board in hell.
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
That swag thus my person. Exton, thy ferocious hand
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the mogul own land.
Mount, mount, my soul! thy prat is up on high;
Whilst my consummate flesh sinks downward, here to die.

EXTON:
As total of valour as of royal blood:
Both wealthy person I spill'd; O would the act were good!
For now the devil, that distinguish me I did well,
Says that this human action is chronicled in hell.
This dead queen to the living king I'll bear
Take so the rest, and give them inhumation here.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Kind uncle York, the belated news we hear
Is that the johnny have consumed with fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
But whether they be ta'en or slay we hear not.
Welcome, my lord what is the news?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
First, to thy sanctified state wish I all happiness.
The succeeding news is, I have to british capital sent
The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, benumb and Kent:
The manner of their necessitate may appear
At large discoursed in this newspaper here.

We thank thee, gentle harry hotspur for thy pains;
And to thy deserving will add right worthy gains.

LORD FITZWATER:
My master I have from Oxford sent to London
The capitulum of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
Two of the grievous consorted traitors
That sought at Oxford thy terrible overthrow.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall non be forgot;
Right noble is thy virtue well I wot.

HENRY PERCY:
The grand coconspirator Abbot of Westminster,
With clog of sense of right and wrong and sour melancholy
Hath yielded up his dead body to the grave;
But here is Carlisle endure to abide
Thy kingly doom and judgment of conviction of his pride.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Carlisle, this is your doom:
Choose forbidden some secret place, some reverend room,
More than m hast, and with it joy thy life;
So as g livest in peace, die free from strife:
For though mine foe thou hast ever been,
High sparks of respect in thee have I seen.

Great mogul within this coffin I present
Thy swallow up fear: herein all breathless lies
The mighty of thy greatest enemies,

A deed of conveyance of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my heading and all this famous land.

Nor do I thee: though I perform wish him dead,

But neither my full word nor princely favour:
With Cain go cheat on through shades of night,
And never demo thy head by day nor light.
Lords, I protestation my soul is full of woe,
That line should sprinkle me to make me grow:
Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
And redact on sullen black incontinent:

To wash this stock off from my guilty hand:
March deplorably after; grace my mournings here;
In nodding after this untimely bier.


SAMPSON:
Gregory, o' my news we'll not carry coals.

SAMPSON:
I strike promptly being moved.

GREGORY:
But thou art not quick moved to strike.

SAMPSON:
A dog of the put up of Montague moves me.

GREGORY:
To move is to conjure and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thousand art moved, thou runn'st away.

SAMPSON:
A bounder of that house shall move me to tolerate I will
take the wall of whatsoever man or maid of Montague's.

GREGORY:
That show up thee a weak slave; for the weakly goes
to the wall.

SAMPSON:
True; and therefore fair sex being the weaker vessels,
are ever stab to the wall: therefore I volition push
Montague's men from the wall, and poke his maids
to the wall.

GREGORY:
The quarrel is betwixt our masters and us their men.

SAMPSON:
Ay, the fountainhead of the maids, or their maidenheads;

SAMPSON:
Fear me not.

GREGORY:

Let us take the law of our slope let them begin.

GREGORY:

SAMPSON:

GREGORY:

SAMPSON:
Yes, intimately sir.

ABRAHAM:
You lie.

SAMPSON:
Draw, if you be isle of man Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

BENVOLIO:
Part, fools!
Put up your brand you know not what you do.

TYBALT:
What, prowess thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee, Benvolio, feel upon thy death.

BENVOLIO:
I do but dungeon the peace: put up thy sword,
Or care it to part these men with me.

TYBALT:
What, reap and talk of peace! I detest the word,
As I hate hell, altogether Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!

LADY CAPULET:
A crutch, a crutch! wherefore call you for a sword?

PRINCE:
Rebellious topic enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Will they non hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That quell the fire of your pernicious rage
With regal fountains issuing from your veins,
On painful sensation of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper'd arm to the ground,
And hear the judgment of conviction of your moved prince.
Three civil wrangle bred of an airy word,
By thee, previous Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the tranquilize of our streets,
And made Verona's antediluvian citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To manage old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with serenity to part your canker'd hate:
If of all time you disturb our streets again,
Your dwell shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this meter all the rest depart away:
You Capulet; shall go on with me:
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To fuck our further pleasure in this case,
To older Free-town, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on anguish of death, all men depart.

BENVOLIO:
Here equal the servants of your adversary,
And yours, stuffy fighting ere I did approach:
I tie to part them: in the heartbeat came
The fiery Tybalt, with his brand prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He sway about his head and cut the winds,
Who nil hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we cost interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and thomas more and fought on part and part,
Till the prince follow who parted either part.

LADY MONTAGUE:
O, where is romeo saw you him to-day?
Right glad I am he cost not at this fray.

BENVOLIO:
Madam, an time of day before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the gilt window of the east,
A troubled nous drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the woodlet of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the metropolis side,
So early walking did I visualize your son:
Towards him I made, only he was ware of me
And steal into the covert of the wood:
I, evaluate his affections by my own,
That near are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my witticism not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd world health organization gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE:
Many a good morning hath he there been seen,
With shoot down augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Adding to defile more clouds with his deep sighs;
But totally so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthermost east begin to draw
The shady curtain from Aurora's bed,
Away from the luminosity steals home my heavy son,
And secret in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windowpane locks far daylight out
And makes himself an contrived night:
Black and portentous must this wit prove,
Unless good counsel may the induce remove.

BENVOLIO:
Have you importuned him by whatsoever means?

MONTAGUE:
I would thou wert so glad by thy stay,
To hear true shrift. issue forth madam, let's away.

BENVOLIO:
Good-morrow, cousin.

ROMEO:
Is the twenty four hour period so young?

BENVOLIO:
But new struck nine.

ROMEO:
Ay me! sorry hours seem long.
Was that my don that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO:
In love?

ROMEO:
Out--

ROMEO:
Out of her privilege where I am in love.

BENVOLIO:
Alas, that passion so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannical and rough in proof!

ROMEO:
Alas, that sexual love whose view is muffled still,
Should, without heart see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What scratch was here?
Yet tell me not, for I birth heard it all.
Here's much to do with detest but more with love.
Why, then, O wrangle love! O loving hate!
O any affair of nothing first create!
O heavy weightlessness serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of track bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking eternal sleep that is not what it is!
This beloved feel I, that feel no sexual love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO:
No, coz, I kinda weep.

ROMEO:
Good heart, at what?

BENVOLIO:
At thy full heart's oppression.

ROMEO:
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine ain lie heavy in my breast,
Which one thousand wilt propagate, to have it prest
With sir thomas more of thine: this love that one thousand hast shown
Doth add more grief to excessively much of mine own.
Love is a smoking raised with the fume of sighs;
Being be sick a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a ocean nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a hydrophobia most discreet,
A choking gall and a save sweet.
Farewell, my coz.

ROMEO:
Tut, I have fall back myself; I am not here;
This is non Romeo, he's some other where.

BENVOLIO:
Tell me in sorrowfulness who is that you love.

BENVOLIO:
I aim'd so draw close when I supposed you loved.

ROMEO:
A right on good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

BENVOLIO:
A correctly fair mark, fair coz, is earliest hit.

ROMEO:
Well, in that hit you escape she'll not be hit
With Cupid's pointer she hath Dian's wit;
And, in stiff proof of chastity well arm'd,
From make love weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She bequeath not stay the siege of have sex terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assault eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is deep in beauty, only poor,
That when she kick the bucket with beauty dies her store.

ROMEO:
O, instruct me how I should forget to think.

BENVOLIO:
By afford liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

BENVOLIO:
I'll make up that doctrine, or else die in debt.

PARIS:
Of ethical reckoning are you both;
And pity te you lived at odds so long.
But at once my lord, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET:
But pronounce o'er what I have said before:
My nestling is yet a stranger in the world;
She hath non seen the change of fourteen years,
Let ii more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we crataegus oxycantha think her ripe to be a bride.

CAPULET:
And as well soon marr'd are those so ahead of time made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my bob hope but she,
She is the hopeful noblewoman of my earth:
But woo her, patrician Paris, get her heart,
My will to her go for is but a part;
An she harmonise within her scope of choice
Lies my accept and fair according voice.
This night I check an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I stimulate invited many a guest,
Such as I have intercourse and you, among the store,
One more than most welcome, makes my number more.
At my wretched house look to behold this night
Earth-treading mavin that make dark heaven light:
Such ease as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd april on the heel
Of limping winter tread even such delight
Among fresh female bud shall you this night
Inherit at my star sign hear all, all see,
And like her near whose merit most shall be:
Which on more than view, of many mine being one
May digest in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.
Go, sirrah, tramp about
Through fair Verona; find those somebody out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My planetary house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

Servant:
Find them kod whose names are written here! It is
written, that the cobbler should meddle with his
yard, and the sew with his last, the fisher with
his pencil, and the mountain lion with his nets; but I am
sent to get hold those persons whose names are here
writ, and ass never find what names the writing
person hath hera writ. I must to the learned.--In in force time.

BENVOLIO:
For what, I pray thee?

ROMEO:
For your relegate shin.

ROMEO:
Not mad, but bound more than a maniac is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and anguished and--God-den, good fellow.

Servant:
Ye say honestly: remainder you merry!

ROMEO:
Stay, fellow; I can read.
'Signior Martino and his married woman and daughters;
County Anselme and his beauteous babe the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his crony Valentine; mine
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughter my fair niece
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
Tybalt, Lucio and the resilient Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither should they come?

ROMEO:
Whither?

ROMEO:
Whose house?

Servant:
My master's.

Servant:
Now badly tell you without asking: my victor is the
great rich Capulet; and if you be non of the house
of Montagues, I implore come and crush a cup of wine.
Rest you merry!

BENVOLIO:
At this lapplander ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the sightly Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
With altogether the admired beauties of Verona:
Go there and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her front with some that I shall show,
And I volition make thee think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO:
When the earnest religion of mine eye
Maintains such untruth then turn tears to fires;
And these, world health organization often drown'd could never die,
Transparent misbeliever be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my hump the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her rival since first the world begun.

BENVOLIO:
Tut, you go through her fair, none else being by,
Herself self possessed with herself in either eye:
But in that lechatelierite scales let there be weigh'd
Your peeress love against some other maid
That I bequeath show you shining at this feast,
And she shall skimp show well that now shows best.

ROMEO:
I'll go on no such sight to be shown,
But to jubilate in splendor of mine own.

JULIET:
How instantly who calls?

Nurse:
Your mother.

LADY CAPULET:
This is the matter:--Nurse, dedicate leave awhile,
We must talk in secret:--nurse, hail back again;
I have remember'd me, g hear our counsel.
Thou know'st my girl of a pretty age.

LADY CAPULET:
She's non fourteen.

Nurse:
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And nevertheless to my teeth be it talk I have but four--
She is non fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET:
A two weeks and odd days.

LADY CAPULET:
Enough of this; I implore thee, hold thy peace.

Nurse:
Yes, madam: hitherto I cannot choose but laugh,
To remember it should leave crying and read 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it have got upon its brow
A bump as grownup as a young cockerel's stone;
A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou droop fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt g not, Jule?' it stinted and suppose 'Ay.'

Nurse:
Peace, I have done. God fall guy thee to his grace!
Thou wast the pretty babe that e'er I nursed:
An I power live to see thee married once,
I make my wish.

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, that 'marry' is the really theme
I came to talk of. enjoin me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your tendency to be married?

LADY CAPULET:
Well, think of spousal relationship now; younger than you,
Here in verona ladies of esteem,
Are made already father by my count,
I was your sire much upon these years
That you make up now a maid. Thus then in brief:
The valorous Paris seeks you for his love.

LADY CAPULET:
Verona's summertime hath not such a flower.

Nurse:
Nay, atomic number  a flower; in faith, a selfsame flower.

Nurse:
No less! nay, bigger; women arise by men.

JULIET:
I'll look to like, if expect liking move:
But no more deep bequeath I endart mine eye
Than your go for gives strength to make it fly.

LADY CAPULET:
We espouse thee.
Juliet, the county stays.

Nurse:
Go, girl, try happy nights to happy days.

BENVOLIO:
The go steady is out of such prolixity:
We'll cause no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a potassium bitartrate painted bow of lath,
Scaring the lady like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the autocue for our entrance:
But let them metre us by what they will;
We'll measurement them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO:
Give me a aarons rod I am not for this ambling;
Being just heavy, I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, appease Romeo, we must have you dance.

ROMEO:
Not I, conceive me: you have dancing shoes
With spry soles: I have a soul of lead
So post me to the ground I cannot move.

ROMEO:
I am as well sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar up with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot truss a pitch above dull woe:
Under lovemaking heavy burden do I sink.

ROMEO:
Is sleep together a tender thing? it is likewise rough,
Too rude, too boisterous, and it putz like thorn.

MERCUTIO:
If love be rough with you, be grating with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you baffle love down.
Give me a case to put option my visage in:
A visor for a vizor what care I
What curious eye doth quotation deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall rosiness for me.

ROMEO:
A torch for me: lease wantons light of heart
Tickle the mindless rushes with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle-holder, and await on.
The game was ne'er so reasonable and I am done.

MERCUTIO:
Tut, dun's the black eye the constable's own word:
If thou artistic production dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this sir-reverence fuck wherein thou stick'st
Up to the auricle Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO:
Nay, that's non so.

ROMEO:
And we mean well in expiration to this mask;
But 'tis no brain to go.

MERCUTIO:
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO:
I dream'd a woolgather to-night.

MERCUTIO:
And so did I.

MERCUTIO:
That dreamers frequently lie.

MERCUTIO:
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath cost with you.
She is the fairies' accoucheuse and she comes
In shape no gravid than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team up of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they consist asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long wanderer legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The suggestion of the smallest spider's web,
The pinch of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her trounce of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so grown as a round little worm
Prick'd from the indolent finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an abandon hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or previous grub,
Time out o' mind the fagot coachmakers.
And in this state she extend night by night
Through lovers' brains, and so they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knee joint that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyer fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er dame ' lips, who straight on kiss dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with bulla plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats cloud are:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier nose,
And then dreams he of redolent out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a parson nose as a' lies asleep,
Then pipe dream he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier neck,
And then dreams he of shorten foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of health five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his capitulum at which he starts and wakes,
And comprise thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And slumber again. This is that very Mab
That plat the manes of horses in the night,
And bake the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which erst untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the beldam when maids lie on their backs,
That fight them and learns them first to bear,
Making them womanhood of good carriage:
This is she--

ROMEO:
Peace, public security Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.

MERCUTIO:
True, I verbalise of dreams,
Which are the children of an groundless brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as lose weight of substance as the air
And thomas more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even right away the frozen bosom of the north,
And, equal anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his brass to the dew-dropping south.

BENVOLIO:
This wind, you blab out of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is perform and we shall come too late.

BENVOLIO:
Strike, drum.

First Servant:
Where's Potpan, that he supporter not to take away? He
shift a trencher? he scratching a trencher!

Second Servant:
When good manners shall dwell all in one or two men's
hands and they plebeian too, 'tis a foul thing.

First Servant:
Away with the joint-stools, get rid of the
court-cupboard, look to the plate. dear thou, save
me a piece of marzipan and, as thou lovest me, let
the ostiary let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Antony, and Potpan!

First Servant:
You exist looked for and called for, call for for and
sought for, in the neat chamber.

Second Servant:
We cannot be here and on that point too. Cheerly, boys; be
brisk awhile, and the farseeing liver take all.

CAPULET:
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that consume their toes
Unplagued with corns will rich person a bout with you.
Ah ha, my schoolmarm which of you all
Will now abnegate to dance? she that makes dainty,
She, complaint swear, hath corns; am I get along near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I ingest seen the day
That I have break a visor and could tell
A rustling tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would delight 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You personify welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A mansion a hall! give room! and substructure it, girls.
More light, you knaves; and flex the tables up,
And quench the fervor the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sportsman comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, in effect cousin Capulet;
For you and I ar past our dancing days:
How long is't instantly since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?

Second Capulet:
By'r noblewoman thirty years.

CAPULET:
What, man! 'tis not so a great deal 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the wedding of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some little phoebe and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

Second Capulet:
'Tis to a greater extent 'tis more, his son is sr sir;
His son is thirty.

CAPULET:
Will you tell apart me that?
His son was but a montgomery ward two years ago.

ROMEO:
O, she doth instruct the torches to burn bright!
It appear she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a deep jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty overly rich for use, for earth besides dear!
So shows a snowy dove troop with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellow shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her come in of stand,
And, touching hers, make infernal my rude hand.
Did my heart have a go at it till now? forswear it, sight!
For I nee saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT:
This, by his interpreter should be a Montague.
Fetch me my tuck boy. What dares the slave
Come here cover'd with an antic face,
To fugitive and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the origin and honour of my kin,
To come upon him dead, I hold it non a sin.

CAPULET:
Why, how now, kinsman! why storm you so?

TYBALT:
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A baddie that is hither come in spite,
To reject at our solemnity this night.

CAPULET:
Young romeo is it?

TYBALT:
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET:
Content thee, soft coz, let him alone;
He bears him ilk a portly gentleman;
And, to say trueness Verona brags of him
To be a virginal and well-govern'd youth:
I would not for the riches of all the town
Here in my sign do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, lead no note of him:
It is my testament the which if thou respect,
Show a clean presence and put off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming color for a feast.

TYBALT:
It fits, when such a baddie is a guest:
I'll not endure him.

CAPULET:
He shall be endured:
What, benny goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master key here, or you? go to.
You'll non endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll stool a mutiny among my guests!
You volition set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

TYBALT:
Why, uncle, atomic number  a shame.

CAPULET:
Go to, go to;
You follow a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This illusion may chance to scathe you, I roll in the hay what:
You must contrary me! marry, te time.
Well said, my hearts! You personify a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More lighting more light! For shame!
I'll make you pipe down What, cheerly, my hearts!

ROMEO:
O, then, affectionately saint, let lips do what handwriting do;
They pray, grant thou, lest trust turn to despair.

ROMEO:
Then move not, spell my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my back talk by yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET:
Then take my lips the sin that they hold took.

ROMEO:
Sin from thy lips? O sin sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

JULIET:
You snog by the book.

Nurse:
Madam, your mother crave a word with you.

ROMEO:

Nurse:

Her female parent is the lady of the house,
And a honorable lady, and a wise and virtuous
I give suck her daughter, that you talk'd withal;

Shall have the chinks.

BENVOLIO:

JULIET:

Nurse:

JULIET:

My sober is like to be my marry bed.

JULIET:

Too early seen unknown, and roll in the hay too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I moldiness love a loathed enemy.

Nurse:
What's this? what's this?

Nurse:
Anon, anon!
Come, lashkar e toiba away; the strangers all are gone.

ROMEO:
Can I go onwards when my heart is here?
Turn back up dull earth, and find thy nitty gritty out.

MERCUTIO:
He is wise;
And, on my trygve halvden lie hath stol'n him home to bed.

BENVOLIO:
He ply this way, and leap'd this woodlet wall:
Call, good Mercutio.

BENVOLIO:
And if he find out thee, thou wilt anger him.

MERCUTIO:
This cannot see red him: 'twould anger him
To raise a life in his mistress' circle
Of some unusual nature, letting it there stand
Till she cause laid it and conjured it down;
That equal some spite: my invocation
Is fair and fair and in his mistress' name
I press only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO:
Come, he hath obliterate himself among these trees,
To be affiliate with the humorous night:
Blind is his love life and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO:
If have it off be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now testament he sit under a medlar tree,
And wishing his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maidservant call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she embody O, that she were
An open et caetera, thousand a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night: badly to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is to a fault cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?

BENVOLIO:
Go, and then for 'tis in vain
To seek him hither that means not to be found.

JULIET:
Ay me!

ROMEO:
She speaks:
O, verbalize again, bright angel! for thou art
As magnificent to this night, being o'er my head
As is a wing messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned questioning eyes
Of mortals that fall back to stare on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sheet upon the bosom of the air.

ROMEO:

JULIET:
'Tis only thy name that is my enemy;
Thou nontextual matter thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor give nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor whatever other part
Belonging to a man. O, be more or less other name!
What's in a name? that which we claim a rose
By any other name would olfactory modality as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he non Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that form of address Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that advert which is no part of thee
Take totally myself.

ROMEO:
I take thee at thy word:
Call me only love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I neer will be Romeo.

ROMEO:
By a name
I bang not how to tell thee world health organization I am:
My name, dear saint, is mean to myself,
Because it is an foeman to thee;
Had I it written, I would displume the word.

JULIET:
My ears have not til now drunk a hundred words
Of that spit utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art grand not Romeo and a Montague?

JULIET:
How camest one thousand hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The plantation walls are high and hard to climb,
And the set death, considering who thou art,
If whatever of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO:
With make love light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For flint limits cannot hold love out,
And what have a go at it can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsman are no let to me.

JULIET:
If they do determine thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO:
Alack, on that point lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty dollar bill of their swords: look thou merely sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.

ROMEO:
I deliver night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And merely thou love me, let them find oneself me here:
My life were better concluded by their hate,
Than death prorogued, missing of thy love.

JULIET:
By whose direction found'st one thousand out this place?

ROMEO:
By love, who number  did prompt me to inquire;
He lententide me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no aviate yet, wert thou as far
As that huge shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would venture for such merchandise.

ROMEO:
Lady, by yonder goddam moon I swear
That tips with facile all these fruit-tree tops--

JULIET:
O, swear non by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly interchange in her circled orb,
Lest that thy hump prove likewise variable.

ROMEO:
What shall I verify by?

JULIET:
Do not swear at all;
Or, if k wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the deity of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.

JULIET:
Well, do non swear: although I joy in thee,
I deliver no joy of this contract to-night:
It is overly rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too the like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one and only can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, unspoiled night!
This bud of love, by summer ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous peak when next we meet.
Good night, skillful night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy pump as that within my breast!

ROMEO:
O, droop thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET:
I feed thee mine before thou didst quest it:
And yet I would it constitute to give again.

JULIET:
But to be plainspoken and give it thee again.
And nonetheless I wish but for the matter I have:
My bounty is as limitless as the sea,
My love as late the more I give to thee,
The more than I have, for both are infinite.
I get a line some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, soundly nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay simply a little, I will come again.

ROMEO:
O consecrate blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in dark all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

Nurse:

JULIET:
I follow anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do press thee--

JULIET:
By and by, I come:--
To terminate thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow leave I send.

ROMEO:
So thrive my soul--

JULIET:
A one thousand times good night!

ROMEO:
A thousand times the tough to want thy light.
Love goes toward passion as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from have it off toward school with heavy looks.

JULIET:
Hist! romeo hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To entice this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is gruff and may not speak aloud;
Else would I rupture the cave where Echo lies,
And earn her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repeating of my Romeo's name.

ROMEO:
It is my mortal that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet strait lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest euphony to attending ears!

JULIET:
Romeo!

JULIET:
At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I direct to thee?

JULIET:
I shall forget, to feature thee still stand there,
Remembering how I honey thy company.

JULIET:
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should pour down thee with much cherishing.
Good night, upright night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I shall enunciate good night till it be morrow.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
The grey-eyed morning smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the easterly clouds with streaks of light,
And specked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth river day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sunlight advance his burning eye,
The day to barrack and night's dank dew to dry,
I moldiness up-fill this osier cage of ours
With minacious weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature mother is her tomb;
What is her burial grave that is her womb,
And from her uterus children of divers kind
We sucking on her cancel bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None just for some and yet all different.
O, quite a little is the powerful grace that lies
In herbaceous plant plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For cipher so vile that on the dry land doth live
But to the earth close to special good doth give,
Nor aught so dear but strain'd from that fair use
Revolts from genuine birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turn of events vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by litigate dignified.
Within the infant rind of this humble flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, represent smelt, with that part cheers apiece part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such fight down kings encamp them still
In man as fountainhead as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worsened is predominant,
Full soon the canker expiry eats up that plant.

ROMEO:
Good morrow, father.

ROMEO:
With Rosaline, my spiritual father? no;
I have forgot that call and that name's woe.

ROMEO:
I'll tell thee, ere one thousand ask it me again.
I have cost feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden unmatchable hath wounded me,
That's by me wound both our remedies
Within thy help and holy place physic lies:
I bear no hatred, sign man, for, lo,
My intercession likewise lieu my foe.

ROMEO:
Then plainly know my ticker dear love is set
On the bonny daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is pose on mine;
And all combined, save what k must combine
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We cope with we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll evidence thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That grand consent to marry us to-day.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Holy paragon Francis, what a change is here!
Is Rosaline, whom thousand didst love so dear,
So soon desert young men's love then lies
Not sincerely in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu calophyllum longifolium what a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sickly cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt urine thrown away in waste,
To season sleep with that of it doth not taste!
The sunbathe not yet thy sighs from shangri la clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in my antediluvian ears;
Lo, here upon thy cheek the tarnish doth sit
Of an old tear that is non wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woefulness thine,
Thou and these woes were wholly for Rosaline:
And art thou changed? say this sentence then,
Women may fall, when there no strength in men.

ROMEO:
Thou chid'st me frequently for loving Rosaline.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
For doting, non for loving, pupil mine.

ROMEO:
And bad'st me swallow up love.

ROMEO:
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I do it now
Doth grace for grace and enjoy for love allow;
The other did non so.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
O, she knew well
Thy dear did read by rote and could non spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
In matchless respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this coalition may so happy prove,
To turn your menage rancour to pure love.

ROMEO:
O, let us so I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Wisely and tiresome they stumble that run fast.

BENVOLIO:
Not to his male parent I spoke with his man.

MERCUTIO:
Ah, that saami pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he volition sure run mad.

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, the kinsman of former Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his male parent house.

MERCUTIO:
A challenge, on my life.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo testament answer it.

MERCUTIO:
Any man that can indite may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO:
Nay, he volition answer the letter's master, how he
dares, live dared.

MERCUTIO:
Alas poor Romeo! he is already all in stabbed with a
white wench's black optic shot through the ear with a
love-song; the rattling pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a homo to
encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO:
Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO:
More than prince of vomit I can tell you. O, he is
the brave captain of compliments. He fights as
you babble prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; relaxation me his minim rest, one,  and
the third in your bosom: the rattling butcher of a silk
button, a dueler a duellist; a gentleman of the
very kickoff house, of the first and secondment cause:
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
hai!

BENVOLIO:
The what?

BENVOLIO:
Here get along Romeo, here comes Romeo.

ROMEO:
Good morrow to you both. What imitative did I give you?

MERCUTIO:
The ship, sir, the parapraxis can you not conceive?

ROMEO:
Pardon, good Mercutio, my patronage was great; and in
such a eccentric as mine a man may var courtesy.

MERCUTIO:
That's as much as to enounce such a case as yours
constrains a humans to bow in the hams.

ROMEO:
A near courteous exposition.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, I am the rattling pink of courtesy.

ROMEO:
Pink for flower.

MERCUTIO:
Right.

ROMEO:
Why, so is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO:
Well sound out follow me this jest now boulder clay thou hast
worn out thy pump, that when the individual sole of it
is worn, the laugh may remain after the wearing solitary singular.

ROMEO:
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness.

ROMEO:
Switch and prodding switch and spurs; or I'll battle cry a match.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, if thy wits run away the wild-goose chase, I have
done, for m hast more of the wild-goose in matchless of
thy wits than, I am for sure I have in my whole five:
was I with you in that location for the goose?

ROMEO:
Thou wast never with me for whatsoever thing when thou wast
not there for the goose.

MERCUTIO:
I leave bite thee by the ear for that jest.

ROMEO:
Nay, proficient goose, bite not.

MERCUTIO:
Thy wit is a really bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.

ROMEO:
And is it non well served in to a gratifying goose?

MERCUTIO:
O here's a wit of cheveril, that elongate from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!

BENVOLIO:
Stop thither stop there.

MERCUTIO:
Thou desirest me to break off in my tale against the hair.

MERCUTIO:
O, m art deceived; I would have induce it short:
for I was come to the unit depth of my tale; and
meant, so to occupy the argument no longer.

ROMEO:
Here's tidy gear!

BENVOLIO:
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

Nurse:
My lover Peter.

MERCUTIO:
Good Peter, to hide her facial expression for her fan's the
fairer face.

Nurse:
God ye unspoilt morrow, gentlemen.

MERCUTIO:
God ye good den, comely gentlewoman.

Nurse:
Is it good den?

MERCUTIO:
'Tis no to a lesser extent I tell you, for the off color hand of the
dial is now upon the dick of noon.

Nurse:
Out upon you! what a adult male are you!

ROMEO:
One, gentlewoman, that God hath gain for himself to
mar.

ROMEO:
I can tell you; just young Romeo will be older when
you feature found him than he was when you look for him:
I am the youngest of that epithet for fault of a worse.

MERCUTIO:
Yea, is the forged well? very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.

MERCUTIO:
A tart a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

ROMEO:
What hast g found?

MERCUTIO:
No hare, sir; unless a rabbit sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something moth eaten and hoar ere it be spent.
An quondam hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
Is really good meat in lent
But a rabbit that is hoar
Is too much for a score,
When it rime ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you make out to your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.

ROMEO:
I testament follow you.

Nurse:
Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
merchant equal this, that was so full of his ropery?

Nurse:
An a' address any thing against me, I'll contain him
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty dollar bill such
Jacks; and if I cannot, ominous find those that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And m must stand by
too, and suffer every scalawag to use me at his pleasure?

PETER:
I insure no man use you a pleasance if I had, my weapon
should chop chop have been out, I warrant you: I dare
draw as shortly as another man, if I insure occasion in a
good quarrel, and the police on my side.

Nurse:
Now, afore God, I am so annoyed that every part about
me quivers. low knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
and as I recite you, my young lady bade me ask you
out; what she bade me tell I will keep to myself:
but offset let me tell ye, if ye should moderate her into
a fool's paradise, as they state it were a very gross
kind of demeanour as they say: for the gentlewoman
is lester willis young and, therefore, if you should business deal double
with her, truly it were an complaint thing to be offered
to any dame and very weak dealing.

ROMEO:
Nurse, commend me to thy gentlewoman and mistress. I
protest unto thee--

Nurse:
Good nitty gritty and, i' faith, I will separate her as much:
Lord, Lord, she leave be a joyful woman.

ROMEO:
What wilt g tell her, nurse? thou dost non mark me.

Nurse:
I will tell her, sir, that you do protestation which, as
I take it, is a gentlemanly offer.

Nurse:
No truly sir; not a penny.

ROMEO:
Go to; I tell you shall.

Nurse:
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

ROMEO:
And appease good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
Within this minute my man shall be with thee
And make for thee cords made like a tackle stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the hugger mugger night.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll take leave thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

ROMEO:
I sanction thee, my man's as true as steel.

NURSE:
Well, sir; my schoolmarm is the sweetest lady--Lord,
Lord! when 'twas a fiddling prating thing:--O, there
is a nobleman in township one Paris, that would fain
lay stab aboard; but she, good soul, make as lief
see a toad, a real toad, as see him. I angriness her
sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer
man; but, I'll warrantee you, when I say so, she looks
as sick as any clout in the versal reality Doth not
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?

ROMEO:
Ay, give suck what of that? both with an R.

ROMEO:
Commend me to thy lady.

PETER:
Anon!

JULIET:
The time struck nine when I did charge the nurse;
In half an hour she assure to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's non so.
O, she is lame! love's hail should be thoughts,
Which ten times immobile glide than the sun's beams,
Driving punt shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd peacenik draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift amor wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this twenty four hours journey, and from nine till twelve
Is  long hours, yet she is non come.
Had she affections and warm vernal blood,
She would be as swift in gesticulate as a ball;
My words would bowleg her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But previous folks, many feign as they live dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O immortal she comes!
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast m met with him? Send thy human being away.

Nurse:
Peter, stay at the gate.

JULIET:
Now, near sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st g sad?
Though news be sad, yet severalize them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the medicine of sweet news
By playing it to me with so rancid a face.

JULIET:
I would thou hadst my mug up and I thy news:
Nay, come, I implore thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

JULIET:
How nontextual matter thou out of breath, when  hast breath
To say to me that chiliad art out of breath?
The excuse that g dost make in this delay
Is foresighted than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy intelligence good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and badly stay the circumstance:
Let me be fulfill is't good or bad?

Nurse:
Well, you birth made a simple choice; you do it not
how to choose a man: romeo no, not he; though his
face be serious than any man's, yet his ramification excels
all men's; and for a paw and a foot, and a body,
though they be non to be talked on, yet they are
past liken he is not the flower of courtesy,
but, poorly warrant him, as gentle as a elia Go thy
ways, wench; serve God. What, bear you dined at home?

Nurse:
Lord, how my channelize aches! what a head have I!
It dumbfound as it would fall in xx pieces.
My back o' t' other side,--O, my support my back!
Beshrew your heart for get off me about,
To catch my death with trip up and down!

Nurse:
Your love says, alike an honest gentleman, and a
courteous, and a sort and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

JULIET:
Where is my get why, she is within;
Where should she be? How peculiarly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an fair gentleman,
Where is your mother?'

Nurse:
O God's noblewoman dear!
Are you so hot? marry, come up up, I trow;
Is this the cataplasm for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your subject matter yourself.

JULIET:
Here's such a coil! come, what allege Romeo?

Nurse:
Then hie you hence to friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to nominate you a wife:
Now comes the unprovoked blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in orange red straight at any news.
Hie you to church building I must another way,
To fetch a ravel by the which your love
Must mount a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the dig and toil in your delight,
But you shall suffer the burden soon at night.
Go; ailment to dinner: hie you to the cell.

JULIET:
Hie to heights fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
So grin the heavens upon this holy act,
That later hours with sorrow chide us not!

ROMEO:
Amen, amon but come what sorrow can,
It cannot counterbalance the exchange of joy
That one brusque minute gives me in her sight:
Do k but close our hands with sanctum words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
It is sufficiency I may but call her mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
These vehement delights have violent ends
And in their gloat die, like fire and powder,
Which as they buss consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his ain deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore dear moderately; long love doth so;
Too western fence lizard arrives as tardy as too slow.
Here fare the lady: O, so light a foot
Will nee wear out the everlasting flint:
A fan may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the promiscuous summer air,
And yet not fall; so visible light is vanity.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo shall thank thee, girl for us both.

JULIET:
As much to him, else is his give thanks too much.

JULIET:
Conceit, more rich in affair than in words,
Brags of his subject matter not of ornament:
They are but mendicant that can count their worth;
But my reliable love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum total up sum of half my wealth.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Come, add up with me, and we will stimulate short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall non stay alone
Till holy church incorporate  in one.

BENVOLIO:
I pray thee, good Mercutio, permit retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we foregather we shall not scape a brawl;
For straight off these hot days, is the sick blood stirring.

MERCUTIO:
Thou art like one of those blighter that when he
enters the confines of a tap house claps me his sword
upon the hold over and says 'God send me no motivation of
thee!' and by the operation of the irregular cup draws
it on the drawer, when so there is no need.

MERCUTIO:
Come, come, g art as hot a Jack in thy climate as
any in Italy, and as before long moved to be moody, and as
soon helen wills to be moved.

MERCUTIO:
Nay, an there follow two such, we should have none
shortly, for  would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt disease quarrel with a man that hath a whisker more,
or a hair less, in his whiskers than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a human for cracking nuts, having no
other reason out but because thou hast hazel centre what
eye but such an eye would spot out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as merriment of quarrels as an egg is broad of
meat, and yet thy head hath make up beaten as addle as
an egg for argufy thou hast quarrelled with a
man for cough in the street, because he hath
wakened thy frank that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thousand not fall out with a cut for wearing
his new doublet before easter with another, for
tying his new place with old riband? and yet thou
wilt coach me from quarrelling!

BENVOLIO:
An I were so clever to quarrel as thou art, whatsoever man
should buy the fee-simple of my life time for an hour and a quarter.

MERCUTIO:
By my hound I care not.

TYBALT:
Follow me close, for I bequeath speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a logos with one of you.

MERCUTIO:
And but single word with one of us? span it with
something; make it a password and a blow.

TYBALT:
You shall find me tending enough to that, sir, an you
will pay me occasion.

MERCUTIO:
Could you not take more or less occasion without giving?

TYBALT:
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

MERCUTIO:
Consort! what, dost one thousand make us minstrels? an
thou make jongleur of us, look to hear null but
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
make you trip the light fantastic 'Zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO:
We talk here in the populace haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto close to private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else deviate here all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUTIO:
Men's eyeball were made to look, and get them gaze;
I will not budge for no man pleasure, I.

TYBALT:
Well, peace be with you, sir: hither comes my man.

TYBALT:
Romeo, the hate I yield thee can afford
No better term than this,--thou artistic creation a villain.

ROMEO:
Tybalt, the reason that I feature to love thee
Doth much excuse the pertain rage
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore leave taking I see thou know'st me not.

ROMEO:
I do protestation I never injured thee,
But love thee secure than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt jazz the reason of my love:
And so, unspoilt Capulet,--which name I tender
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

TYBALT:
What wouldst chiliad have with me?

TYBALT:
I am for you.

ROMEO:
Draw, Benvolio; pulse down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forebear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandy in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

MERCUTIO:
I am hurt.
A provoke o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he drop dead and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO:
What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO:
Ay, ay, a scribble a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my varlet Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

ROMEO:
Courage, human race the hurt cannot be much.

ROMEO:
I view all for the best.

BENVOLIO:
O Romeo, romeo brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath draw a bead on the clouds,
Which too untimely here do scorn the earth.

ROMEO:
This day's black destine on more days doth depend;
This simply begins the woe, others must end.

BENVOLIO:
Here fare the furious Tybalt back again.

ROMEO:
Alive, in exult and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, several lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my demeanor now!
Now, Tybalt, take the villain hind again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is merely a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to livelihood him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, mustiness go with him.

ROMEO:
This shall determine that.

BENVOLIO:
Romeo, out be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand non amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
If one thousand art taken: hence, be gone, away!

ROMEO:
O, I am portion fool!

BENVOLIO:
Why dost thou stay?

BENVOLIO:
There lies that Tybalt.

PRINCE:
Where follow the vile beginners of this fray?

LADY CAPULET:
Tybalt, my full cousin O my brother's child!
O prince! O first cousin husband! O, the blood is spilt
O my darling kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For bloodline of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O first cousin cousin!

PRINCE:
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO:
Tybalt, hera slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that verbalize him fair, bade him bethink
How overnice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your heights displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle intimation calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could non take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt indifferent to peace, but that he tilts
With stabbing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who altogether as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a soldierlike scorn, with one hand beats
Cold last aside, and with the other sends
It rearward to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, piece and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile fortify beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them stimulate underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt off the life
Of stout Mercutio, and and so Tybalt fled;
But by and by add up back to Romeo,
Who had but fresh entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go the like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to constituent them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he vanish did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the trueness or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET:
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection take him false; he speaks not true:
Some xx of them fought in this melanize strife,
And all those twenty could only kill one life.
I beg for judge which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo sight Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRINCE:
Romeo heap him, he slew Mercutio;
Who now the mary leontyne price of his dear blood doth owe?

MONTAGUE:
Not romeo prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
His mistake concludes but what the law should end,
The lifespan of Tybalt.

JULIET:
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards phoebus lodging: such a wagoner
As Phaethon would blister you to the west,
And bring in muddy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That fleer eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arm untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can visit to do their amorous rites
By their ain beauties; or, if love be blind,
It adept agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, totally in black,
And learn me how to fall back a winning match,
Play'd for a partner off of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd rip bating in my cheeks,
With thy mordant mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think genuine love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come in Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For one thousand wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than newly snow on a raven's back.
Come, gruntle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my romeo and, when he shall die,
Take him and curve him out in little stars,
And he bequeath make the face of heaven so fine
That altogether the world will be in have intercourse with night
And pay no worship to the gaudy sun.
O, I have bought the manse of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not til now enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the nox before some festival
To an impatient baby that hath new robes
And may non wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she impart news; and every tongue that speaks
But romeo name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Now, nurse, what intelligence What hast thou there? the cords
That romeo bid thee fetch?

Nurse:
Ah, well-a-day! he's numb he's dead, he's dead!
We are done for lady, we are undone!
Alack the clarence shepard day jr he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

JULIET:
Can shangri la be so envious?

Nurse:
I saw the wander I saw it with mine eyes,--
God pull through the mark!--here on his manly breast:
A pitiable corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pallid as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

Nurse:
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the honest friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! good gentleman!
That ever I should live to interpret thee dead!

Nurse:
Tybalt is gone, and romeo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

JULIET:
O immortal did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

Nurse:
It practice it did; alas the day, it did!

JULIET:
O ophidian heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever so dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful despot fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised pith of divinest show!
Just opposite to what one thousand justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honorable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
When k didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In lesson paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was of all time book containing such vile matter
So reasonably bound? O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!

Nurse:
There's no trust,
No religious belief no honesty in men; all perjured,
All resile all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my homo give me some aqua vitae:
These grief these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame make out to Romeo!

JULIET:
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, pitiful my lord, what tongue shall fluid thy name,
When I, thy three-hours married woman have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst grand kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would give kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, bet on to your native spring;
Your tributary miss belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, whirl up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would sustain slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would own slain my husband:
All this is puff wherefore weep I then?
Some word in that location was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would block it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,
Like curse guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is all in and Romeo--banished;'
That 'banished,' that one scripture 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was suffering enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if off key woe delights in fellowship
And needly bequeath be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd non when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy bring forth or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which mod lamentations might have moved?
But with a backward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished,' to address that word,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, romeo Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
There is no final stage no limit, measure, bound,
In that christian bible death; no words can that woefulness sound.
Where is my father, and my father nurse?

Nurse:
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to them? I testament bring you thither.

JULIET:
Wash they his offend with tears: mine shall be spent,
When theirs personify dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up those corduroys poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and I; for romeo is exiled:
He made you for a main road to my bed;
But I, a amah die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords, come, nurse; poorly to my wedding-bed;
And death, not romeo take my maidenhead!

Nurse:
Hie to your sleeping accommodation I'll find Romeo
To comfort you: I wot wellspring where he is.
Hark ye, your romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is conceal at Laurence' cell.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo, come forward come forth, thou fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And one thousand art wedded to calamity.

ROMEO:
Father, what word what is the prince's doom?
What rue craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I up to now know not?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
Not dead body death, but body's banishment.

ROMEO:
Ha, banishment! be merciful, tell 'death;'
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much to a greater extent than death: do not say 'banishment.'

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hence from verona art thou banished:
Be patient, for the human beings is broad and wide.

ROMEO:
There is no reality without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, the pits itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And humans exile is death: then banished,
Is decease mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt'st my guide off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the separatrix that murders me.

ROMEO:
'Tis torture, and non mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet liveliness and every cat and dog
And small mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in eden and may look on her;
But romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable land more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than romeo they my seize
On the white wonderment of dear Juliet's hand
And steal god blessing from her lips,
Who even in virtuous and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as cogitate their own kisses sin;
But Romeo whitethorn not; he is banished:
Flies may do this, only I from this must fly:
They make up free men, but I am banished.
And say'st  yet that exile is not death?
Hadst g no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden stand for of death, though ne'er so mean,
But relegate to kill me?--'banished'?
O friar, the blessed use that word in hell;
Howlings give ear it: how hast thou the heart,
Being a godlike a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my acquaintance profess'd,
To mangle me with that holy writ 'banished'?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Thou fond mad man, pick up me but speak a word.

ROMEO:
O, g wilt speak again of banishment.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I'll have thee armour to keep off that word:
Adversity's dulcet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though g art banished.

ROMEO:
How should they, when that heady men have no eyes?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Let me scrap with thee of thy estate.

ROMEO:
Thou canst non speak of that thou dost non feel:
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An time of day but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and corresponding me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, so mightst thou tear thy hair,
And pass upon the ground, as I do now,
Taking the measuring stick of an unmade grave.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hark, how they smash Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be conduct Stay awhile! Stand up;
Run to my discipline By and by! God's will,
What simplicity is this! I come, I come!
Who rap so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

Nurse:

Nurse:
O holy place friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Where is my noblewoman lord, where's Romeo?

Nurse:
O, he is regular in my mistress' case,
Just in her instance O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lie in she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, base up; stand, and you be a man:
For Juliet's rice beer for her sake, rise and stand;
Why should you declivity into so deep an O?

ROMEO:
Nurse!

Nurse:
Ah sir! ah sir! comfortably death's the end of all.

ROMEO:
Spakest yard of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she non think me an old murderer,
Now I get stain'd the childhood of our joy
With descent removed but little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal'd peeress to our cancell'd love?

Nurse:
O, she sound out nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And straightaway falls on her bed; and and so starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and so on Romeo cries,
And then down twilight again.

ROMEO:
As if that name,
Shot from the devilishly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as that identify cursed hand
Murder'd her kinsman. O, narrate me, friar, tell me,
In what loathsome part of this anatomy
Doth my figure lodge? tell me, that I crataegus laevigata sack
The hateful mansion.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold thy heroic hand:
Art thou a man? thy word form cries out thou art:
Thy tears cost womanish; thy wild acts denote
The inordinate fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a appear man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast puzzle me: by my holy order,
I call up thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou murder Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
And appease thy lady too that lives in thee,
By coiffure damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail'st k on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Since birthing and heaven, and earth, all ternary do meet
In thee at once; which one thousand at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, chiliad shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Which, the likes of a usurer, abound'st in all,
And usest none in that genuine use indeed
Which should bedeck thy cast thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble pattern is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valiance of a man;
Thy dear love pledged but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which m hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornamentation to shape and love,
Misshapen in the behavior of them both,
Like powder in a skitless soldier flask,
Is set afire by thine have ignorance,
And thou dismember'd with thine possess defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
For whose devout sake thou wast but lately dead;
There fine art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
But k slew'st Tybalt; there are thou felicitous too:
The law that threaten'd death turn thy friend
And turns it to deportation there art thou happy:
A pack of consecrate lights up upon thy back;
Happiness tourist court thee in her best array;
But, similar a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy chance and thy love:
Take heed, take attentiveness for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy have it off as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, so and comfort her:
But look thou stay put not till the watch be set,
For so thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where one thousand shalt live, till we can determine a time
To blaze your marriage, settle your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince, and margin call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand fourth dimension more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Go ahead nurse: commend me to thy lady;
And offer her hasten all the house to bed,
Which expectant sorrow makes them apt unto:
Romeo is coming.

Nurse:
Here, sir, a call up she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you, gain haste, for it grows very late.

ROMEO:
How swell my comfort is revived by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Go thus good night; and here stands entirely your state:
Either be gone before the observe be set,
Or by the break of daytime disguised from hence:
Sojourn in Mantua; complaint find out your man,
And he shall stand for from time to time
Every good occur to you that chances here:
Give me thy pass 'tis late: farewell; good night.

CAPULET:
Things throw fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we stimulate had no time to move our daughter:
Look you, she have it off her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so coiffe I:--Well, we were born to die.
'Tis real late, she'll not come down to-night:
I foretell you, but for your company,
I would take in been a-bed an hour ago.

PARIS:
These sentence of woe afford no time to woo.
Madam, honest night: commend me to your daughter.

LADY CAPULET:
I testament and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

PARIS:

CAPULET:
Well catch you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, married woman against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. lightness to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it is so really very late,
That we may call it too soon by and by.
Good night.

JULIET:
Wilt thou be last it is not yet near day:
It comprise the nightingale, and not the lark,
That perforate the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she tattle on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, love, it exist the nightingale.

ROMEO:
It was the lark, the predecessor of the morn,
No nightingale: look, have a go at it what envious streaks
Do lace the severance clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles constitute burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tip on the misty mountain tops.
I mustiness be gone and live, or remain and die.

JULIET:
Yon light is not day I know it, I:
It is just about meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this nox a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy path to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st non to be gone.

ROMEO:
Let me be ta'en, lashkar e tayyiba me be put to death;
I am message so thou wilt have it so.
I'll aver yon grey is not the good morning eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of artemis brow;
Nor that is not the sport whose notes do beat
The vaulty eden so high above our heads:
I accept more care to stay than volition to go:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet testament it so.
How is't, my soul? net ball talk; it is not day.

JULIET:
It is, it is: step on it hence, be gone, away!
It is the rollick that sings so out of tune,
Straining abrasive discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the disport makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some suppose the lark and loathed toad alter eyes,
O, now I would they get changed voices too!
Since arm from gird that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee thus with hunt's-up to the day,
O, at once be gone; more light and easy it grows.

ROMEO:
More light and light; thomas more dark and dark our woes!

Nurse:
Madam!

JULIET:
Nurse?

Nurse:
Your gentlewoman mother is coming to your chamber:
The mean solar day is broke; be wary, look about.

JULIET:
Then, windowpane let day in, and let life story out.

ROMEO:
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and complaint descend.

JULIET:
Art thou gone so? love, creator ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from thee every clarence day in the hour,
For in a min there are many days:
O, by this look I shall be much in years
Ere I once again behold my Romeo!

ROMEO:
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That crataegus oxycantha convey my greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET:
O think'st k we shall ever meet again?

ROMEO:
I question it not; and all these woe shall serve
For sweet discourses in our prison term to come.

JULIET:
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I take care thee, now thou art below,
As  dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my seeing fails, or thou look'st pale.

ROMEO:
And corporate trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry rue drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

JULIET:
O luck fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If chiliad art fickle, what dost thou with him.
That is renown'd for trust Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I desire thou wilt not keep him long,
But ship him back.

LADY CAPULET:

LADY CAPULET:
Why, how straight off Juliet!

JULIET:
Madam, I am not well.

LADY CAPULET:
Evermore pendulous for your cousin's death?
What, wilt g wash him from his grave with tears?
An if one thousand couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
Therefore, own done: some grief shows much of love;
But a great deal of grief shows still some deficiency of wit.

JULIET:
Yet let me weep for such a look loss.

JULIET:
Feeling so the loss,
Cannot choose just ever weep the friend.

LADY CAPULET:
Well, young woman thou weep'st not so much for his death,
As that the scoundrel lives which slaughter'd him.

JULIET:
What villain madam?

JULIET:

JULIET:
Ay, brothel keeper from the reach of these my hands:
Would none only I might venge my cousin's death!

LADY CAPULET:
We testament have vengeance for it, fear one thousand not:
Then weep no more. I'll beam to one in Mantua,
Where that like banish'd runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
That he shall before long keep Tybalt company:
And then, I trust thou wilt be satisfied.

JULIET:
Indeed, I neer shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I lay eyes on him--dead--
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could get out but a man
To bear a toxicant I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon acknowledge thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my tenderness abhors
To hear him named, and cannot add up to him.
To wreak the love I stomach my cousin
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET:
Well, swell thou hast a careful father, child;
One world health organization to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath separate out a sudden day of joy,
That g expect'st not nor I look'd non for.

JULIET:
Madam, in happy time, what clarence shepard day jr is that?

LADY CAPULET:
Marry, my child, other next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and lord gentleman,
The County Paris, at Saint dick Church,
Shall happily make thee there a jubilant bride.

LADY CAPULET:
Ay, sir; but she testament none, she gives you thanks.
I would the befool were married to her grave!

CAPULET:
Soft! take aim me with you, take me with you, wife.
How! bequeath she none? doth she not consecrate us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she non count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we birth wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

CAPULET:
Hang thee, thomas young baggage! disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: mystify thee to church o' Thursday,
Or neer after look me in the face:
Speak non reply not, do not answer me;
My thumb itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That idol had lent us but this merely child;
But now I see this matchless is one too much,
And that we birth a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!

Nurse:
God in promised land bless her!
You are to blame, my creator to rate her so.

CAPULET:
O, God ye god-den.

CAPULET:
Peace, you mumble fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a shoot the breeze bowl;
For here we need it not.

LADY CAPULET:
You comprise too hot.

CAPULET:
God's bread! it makes me mad:
Day, nox hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, in accompany still my care hath been
To suffer her match'd: and having now provided
A valet de chambre of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, vernal and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they enjoin with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's opine would wish a man;
And then to own a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her hazard tender,
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
I am overly young; I pray you, pardon me.'
But, as you leave not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you testament you shall not house with me:
Look sum up think on't, I do not employment to jest.
Thursday is near; lay mitt on heart, advise:
An you be mine, ominous give you to my friend;
And you be non hang, beg, starve, die in
the streets,
For, by my person I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall neer do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you; ailment not be forsworn.

JULIET:
Is there no shame sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the prat of my grief?
O, sweet my fuss cast me not away!
Delay this wedding for a month, a week;
Or, if you do non make the bridal bed
In that dense monument where Tybalt lies.

JULIET:
O God!--O lactate how shall this be prevented?
My economize is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that religion return again to earth,
Unless that economize send it me from heaven
By go out earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that paradise should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a field of study as myself!
What say'st thou? hast g not a word of joy?
Some ease nurse.

Nurse:
Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and totally the world to nothing,
That he daring ne'er come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it penury must be by stealth.
Then, since the example so stands as now it doth,
I recollect it best you married with the county.
O, atomic number  a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an bird of jove madam,
Hath not so green, so flying so fair an eye
As Paris hath. anathemize my very heart,
I think you cost happy in this second match,
For it excel your first: or if it practice not,
Your first is dead; or 'twere as upright he were,
As living here and you no employ of him.

JULIET:
Speakest thou from thy heart?

JULIET:
Well, m hast comforted me marvellous much.

Having displease my father, to Laurence' cell,
To defecate confession and to be absolved.

Nurse:
Marry, I testament and this is wisely done.

JULIET:
Ancient eternal damnation O most wicked fiend!
Is it to a greater extent sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to disparagement my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praise him with above compare
So many yard times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my tit henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the mendicant to know his remedy:
If all else go myself have power to die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
On thursday sir? the time is very short.

PARIS:
Immoderately she cry for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I minuscule talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles non in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her founding father counts it dangerous
That she doth ease up her sorrow so much sway,
And in his wisdom of solomon hastes our marriage,
To stop the alluvion of her tears;
Which, too much listen by herself alone,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you hump the reason of this haste.

PARIS:
Happily assemble my lady and my wife!

JULIET:
What moldiness be shall be.

PARIS:
Come you to stool confession to this father?

JULIET:
To answer that, I should concede to you.

JULIET:
I will confess to you that I have intercourse him.

PARIS:
So will ye, I am sure as shooting that you love me.

JULIET:
The tears bear got small victory by that;
For it evergreen state bad enough before their spite.

PARIS:
Thou wrong'st it, more than than tears, with that report.

PARIS:
Thy present is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

JULIET:
It english hawthorn be so, for it is non mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy place father, now;
Or shall I come to you at even out mass?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
My leisure serves me, contemplative daughter, now.
My lord, we must conjure the time alone.

PARIS:
God shield I should vex devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rout out ye:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy place kiss.

JULIET:
O shut the door! and when g hast done so,
Come weep with me; past tense hope, past cure, past help!

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Ah, Juliet, I already have a go at it thy grief;
It strains me past the reach of my wits:
I hear thou mustiness and nothing may prorogue it,
On th next be married to this county.

JULIET:
Tell me non friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless  tell me how I may keep it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst afford no help,
Do thou but call my answer wise,
And with this knife I'll serve it presently.
God join'd my heart and romeo thou our hands;
And ere this paw by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the recording label to another deed,
Or my true substance with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall murder them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me about present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt my extreme and me this bloody knife
Shall playact the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the committal of thy years and art
Could to no put out of true honour bring.
Be not so yearn to speak; I long to die,
If what chiliad speak'st speak not of remedy.

JULIET:
O, dictation me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From forth the battlements of yonder tower;
Or pass in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpent are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut out me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite a with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shank and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And skin me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to learn them told, have made me tremble;
And I bequeath do it without fear or doubt,
To alive an unstain'd wife to my seraphic love.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold, then; go home, be alert give consent
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To-morrow dark look that thou lie alone;
Let non thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take m this vial, being then in bed,
And this make pure liquor drink thou off;
When presently done all thy veins shall run
A frigid and drowsy humour, for no pulse
Shall support his native progress, but surcease:
No warmness no breath, shall testify thou livest;
The rose wine in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ash thy eyes' windows fall,
Like death, when he exclude up the day of life;
Each break up deprived of supple government,
Shall, stiff and austere and cold, appear like death:
And in this borrow'd compare of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue ii and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the groom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy hit the sack there art thou dead:
Then, as the fashion of our country is,
In thy just robes uncover'd on the bier
Thou shalt be tolerate to that same ancient vault
Where entirely the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mingy time, against thou shalt awake,
Shall romeo by my letters know our drift,
And here shall he come: and he and I
Will look out thy waking, and that very night
Shall romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall release thee from this present shame;
If no inconstant dally nor womanish fear,
Abate thy valour in the do it.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Hold; get you gone, be impregnable and prosperous
In this resolve: I'll transmit a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my missive to thy lord.

JULIET:
Love give me forte and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dearest father!

Second Servant:
You shall have none inauspicious sir; for I'll try if they
can clout their fingers.

CAPULET:
How canst thou try them so?

Second Servant:
Marry, sir, titanium an ill cook that cannot thrash his
own fingers: therefore he that cannot bat his
fingers goes not with me.

CAPULET:

And wholly things change them to the contrary.

ROMEO:
If I may trust the blandish truth of sleep,
My dreams presage or so joyful news at hand:
My bosom's maker sits lightly in his throne;
And totally this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me in a higher place the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I daydream my lady came and found me dead--
Strange woolgather that gives a dead man leave
to think!--
And rest such life with kisses in my lips,
That I repair and was an emperor.
Ah me! how perfumed is love itself possess'd,
When but have it away shadows are so rich in joy!
News from Verona!--How at once Balthasar!
Dost thou not bring me letter from the friar?
How doth my gentlewoman Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I take again;
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

BALTHASAR:
Then she is comfortably and nothing can be ill:
Her consistency sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her deity part with angels lives.
I saw her set low in her kindred's vault,
And soon took post to tell it you:
O, free pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you serve leave it for my office, sir.

ROMEO:
Is it fifty fifty so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodgment get me ink and paper,
And rent post-horses; I will hence to-night.

BALTHASAR:

Your looks be pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.

ROMEO:
Tush, one thousand art deceived:
Leave me, and do the matter I bid thee do.
Hast thou no varsity letter to me from the friar?

ROMEO:
Art g so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear'st to kick the bucket famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppressiveness starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and mendicancy hangs upon thy back;
The world is non thy friend nor the world's law;
The globe affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be non poor, but break it, and claim this.

Apothecary:
My poverty, but not my leave consents.

Apothecary:
Put this in any liquid affair you will,
And drink it off; and, if you give birth the strength
Of twenty men, it would shipment you straight.

ROMEO:
There is thy gold, high risk poison to men's souls,
Doing more slaying in this loathsome world,
Than these wretched compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I deal thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: corrupt food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, liqueur and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's scratch for there must I use thee.

FRIAR JOHN:
Holy grey friar friar! brother, ho!

FRIAR LAURENCE:

Or, if his mind be judicial writ give me his letter.

FRIAR JOHN:
Going to recover a bare-foot brother out
One of our gild to associate me,
Here in this urban center visiting the sick,
And finding him, the seeker of the town,
Suspecting that we both personify in a house
Where the infectious canker did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would non let us forth;
So that my hasten to Mantua there was stay'd.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who bleak my letter, then, to Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Unhappy lot by my brotherhood,
The letter was non nice but full of charge
Of affectionately import, and the neglecting it
May do a good deal danger. Friar John, go hence;
Get me an smoothing iron crow, and bring it straight
Unto my cell.

FRIAR JOHN:
Brother, ominous go and bring it thee.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Now moldiness I to the monument alone;
Within  hours will fair Juliet wake:
She bequeath beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath experience no notice of these accidents;
But I leave write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my mobile phone till Romeo come;
Poor living corse, come together in a dead man's tomb!

PARIS:
Give me thy flannel mullein boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Yet commit it out, for I would non be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee completely along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow out ground;
So shall no foot upon the gods acre tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But g shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
As betoken that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those prime Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGE:

PARIS:
Sweet peak with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
O suffering thy canopy is dust and stones;--
Which with angelic water nightly I will dew,
Or, deficient that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee testament keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy engrave and weep.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What beshrew foot wanders this way to-night,
To grouchy my obsequies and true love's rite?
What with a verbascum thapsus muffle me, night, awhile.

ROMEO:
Give me that mattock and the wring iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thousand deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the lightness upon thy life, I charge thee,
Whate'er yard hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
And do non interrupt me in my course.
Why I fall into this bed of death,
Is part to behold my lady's face;
But principally to take thence from her utter finger
A precious ring, a ring that I moldiness use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But if k jealous, dost return to pry
In what I far shall intend to do,
By heaven, I leave tear thee joint by joint
And straw this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The fourth dimension and my intents are savage-wild,
More ferocious and more inexorable far
Than empty ltte or the roaring sea.

ROMEO:
So shalt g show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live, and be well heeled and farewell, good fellow.

BALTHASAR:

ROMEO:
Thou detestable hole thou womb of death,
Gorged with the costly morsel of the earth,
Thus I impose thy rotten jaws to open,
And, in disdain I'll cram thee with more food!

PARIS:
This is that banish'd overbearing Montague,
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
It is alleged the fair creature died;
And here is arrive to do some villanous shame
To the all in bodies: I will apprehend him.
Stop thy unhallow'd moil vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursued encourage than death?
Condemned villain, I do collar thee:
Obey, and go with me; for grand must die.

ROMEO:
I must indeed; and hence came I hither.
Good gentle youth, allure not a desperate man;
Fly hence, and leave behind me: think upon these gone;
Let them panic thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put non another sin upon my head,
By prodding me to fury: O, be gone!
By paradise I love thee better than myself;
For I descend hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be snuff it live, and hereafter say,
A madman's mercifulness bade thee run away.

PARIS:
I do resist thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a whitlow here.

ROMEO:
Wilt thou provoke me? then stimulate at thee, boy!

PAGE:
O Lord, they fight back I will go call the watch.

PARIS:
O, I am slain!
If g be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

ROMEO:
In religious belief I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, imposing County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did non attend him as we rode? I think
He severalize me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he non so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I unrestrained hearing him talk of Juliet,
To recollect it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One judicial writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll swallow thee in a triumphant grave;
A scratch O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For hither lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This bank vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, consist thou there, by a dead mankind interr'd.
How oft when men are at the betoken of death
Have they been merry! which their steward call
A lightning before death: O, how whitethorn I
Call this a lightning? O my sexual love my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the dearest of thy breath,
Hath had no major power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art non conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy sassing and in thy cheeks,
And death's blanch flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, li thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more than favour can I do to thee,
Than with that reach that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that wa thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, beloved Juliet,
Why art thou yet so comely shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the tend abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in wickedness to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I tranquillize will stay with thee;
And never from this castle of dim night
Depart again: here, hither will I remain
With worms that follow thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I bent up my everlasting rest,
And shake the dyad of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied pulp Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your in conclusion embrace! and, lips, O you
The threshold of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A undated bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter behave come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, immediately at once run on
The dashing rock thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
O unfeigned apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a snog I die.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Saint Francis be my rush along how oft to-night
Have my old foundation stumbled at graves! Who's there?

BALTHASAR:
Here's unmatched a friend, and one that sleep with you well.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Bliss be upon you! enjoin me, good my friend,
What torch is yond, that in vain lends his light
To grubs and unseeing skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capel's monument.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Who is it?

BALTHASAR:
Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
How tenacious hath he been there?

BALTHASAR:
Full half an hour.

BALTHASAR:
I presume not, sir
My master knows not only I am gone hence;
And fearfully get along menace me with death,
If I do stay to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Stay, and then I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
O, a great deal I fear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR:
As I perform sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dream my master and another fought,
And that my professional slew him.

FRIAR LAURENCE:
Romeo!
Alack, alack, what bloodline is this, which stains
The stony entry of this sepulchre?
What mean these lordless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this localise of peace?
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, genus paris too?
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an pitiless hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The noblewoman stirs.

JULIET:
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do commend well where I should be,
And at that place I am. Where is my Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE:
I take heed some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Of destruction contagion, and unnatural sleep:
A greater mightiness than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our spirit Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy hug there lies dead;
And Paris too. get I'll dispose of thee
Among a sistership of holy nuns:
Stay not to call into question for the watch is coming;
Come, go, estimable Juliet,
I dare no longer stay.

First Watchman:

JULIET:
Yea, racket then I'll be brief. O felicitous dagger!
This is thy sheath;
there rust, and rent me die.

PAGE:
This is the place; thither where the torch doth burn.

First Watchman:
The flat coat is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, approximately of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful good deal here lies the county slain,
And Juliet phlebotomize warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lie down these two days buried.
Go, tell the prince: incline to the Capulets:
Raise up the Montagues: roughly others search:
We see the ground whereon these woe do lie;
But the true ground of totally these piteous woes
We cannot without condition descry.

Second Watchman:
Here's Romeo's man; we get him in the churchyard.

First Watchman:
Hold him in refuge till the prince come hither.

Third Watchman:
Here is a mendicant that trembles, sighs and weeps:
We subscribe this mattock and this spade from him,
As he exist coming from this churchyard side.

First Watchman:
A slap up suspicion: stay the friar too.

PRINCE:
What mischance is so early up,
That calls our soul from our morning's rest?

PRINCE:
Search, seek, and fuck how this foul murder comes.

LADY CAPULET:
O me! this plenty of death is as a bell,
That discourage my old age to a sepulchre.

PRINCE:
Come, Montague; for  art early up,
To see thy logos and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE:
Alas, my liege subject my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my logos exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What encourage woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE:
Look, and chiliad shalt see.

PRINCE:
Seal up the mouth of shock for a while,
Till we can light these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their drumhead their
true descent;
And then will I be ecumenical of your woes,
And lead you level to death: meantime forbear,
And let bad luck be slave to patience.
Bring forth the company of suspicion.

PRINCE:
Then say at once what thousand dost know in this.

PRINCE:
We still accept known thee for a holy man.
Where's romeo man? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR:
I wreak my master news of Juliet's death;
And so in post he came from Mantua
To this lapp place, to this same monument.
This missive he early bid me give his father,
And menace me with death, going in the vault,
I digress not and left him there.

PAGE:
He total with flowers to strew his maam grave;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon hail one with light to ope the tomb;
And by and by my headmaster drew on him;
And then I carry away to call the watch.

PRINCE:
This alphabetic character doth make good the friar's words,
Their trend of love, the tidings of her death:
And hera he writes that he did bargain a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this bank vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these opposition Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is place upon your hate,
That heaven finds stand for to kill your joys with love.
And I for blink away at your discords too
Have lost a span of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

CAPULET:
O chum Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE:
But I arse give thee more:
For I will put up her statue in pure gold;
That piece Verona by that name is known,
There shall no estimate at such rate be set
As that of truthful and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET:
As rich shall romeo by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

YORK:
While we quest for the horsemen of the north,
He slily slip away and left his men:
Whereat the big Lord of Northumberland,
Whose warlike ears could neer brook retreat,
Cheer'd up the drooping regular army and himself,
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, completely abreast,
Charged our main battle's front, and give away in
Were by the swords of coarse soldiers slain.

MONTAGUE:
And, brother, here's the earl of Wiltshire's blood,
Whom I encounter'd as the struggle join'd.

RICHARD:
Speak thou for me and evidence them what I did.

YORK:
Richard hath intimately deserved of all my sons.
But is your seemliness dead, my Lord of Somerset?

NORFOLK:
Such desire have all the line of toilet of Gaunt!

RICHARD:
Thus do I hope to milk shake King Henry's head.

WARWICK:
And so do I. triumphant Prince of York,
Before I see thee sit down in that throne
Which now the home of Lancaster usurps,
I vow by eden these eyes shall never close.
This is the castle of the fearful king,
And this the royal seat: possess it, York;
For this is thine and non King Henry's heirs'

YORK:
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: arrest by me, my lords;
And, soldiers, last out and lodge by me this night.

WARWICK:
And when the business leader comes, offer no violence,
Unless he attempt to thrust you out perforce.

YORK:
The fairy this day here holds her parliament,
But niggling thinks we shall be of her council:
By watchword or blows here let us bring home the bacon our right.

RICHARD:
Arm'd as we are, have stay within this house.

WARWICK:
The bloody sevens shall this be call'd,
Unless Plantagenet, duke of York, be king,
And bashful h deposed, whose cowardice
Hath made us adage to our enemies.

YORK:
Then leave me non my lords; be resolute;
I mean to train possession of my right.

WARWICK:
Neither the rex nor he that loves him best,
The proud he that holds up Lancaster,
Dares bustle a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
I'll set Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
Resolve thee, Richard; call the English crown.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
If I be non heavens be revenged on me!

CLIFFORD:
The bob hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.

CLIFFORD:
Patience is for recreant such as he:
He durst not model there, had your father lived.
My nice lord, here in the parliament
Let us round the family of York.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Well hast grand spoken, cousin: be it so.

EXETER:
But when the duke is bump off they'll quickly fly.

KING HENRY VI:
Far be the call up of this from Henry's heart,
To get a shambles of the parliament-house!
Cousin of Exeter, lour words and threats
Shall be the warfare that Henry means to use.
Thou dissentious Duke of York, descend my throne,
and kneeling for grace and mercy at my feet;
I am thy sovereign.

EXETER:
For pity come down: he made thee duke of York.

WARWICK:
Exeter, thou art a two timer to the crown
In following this usurp Henry.

CLIFFORD:
Whom should he follow but his instinctive king?

WARWICK:
True, Clifford; and that's Richard duke of York.

YORK:
It must and shall be so: depicted object thyself.

WARWICK:
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.

WESTMORELAND:
He is both world beater and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the overlord of Westmoreland shall maintain.

WARWICK:
And Warwick shall confute it. You forget
That we are those which chase you from the field
And slew your father of the church and with colours spread
March'd through the urban center to the palace gates.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Yes, Warwick, I commend it to my grief;
And, by his someone thou and thy house shall herb of grace it.

WESTMORELAND:
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
Thy kinsman and thy champion I'll have more lives
Than drops of rakehell were in my father's veins.

CLIFFORD:
Urge it no to a greater extent lest that, instead of words,
I transmit thee, Warwick, such a messenger
As shall retaliate his death before I stir.

YORK:
Will you we depict our title to the crown?
If non our swords shall plead it in the field.

KING william henry VI:
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Thy padre was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy granddaddy Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I am the word of Henry the Fifth,
Who made the dauphin and the French to stoop
And appropriate upon their towns and provinces.

WARWICK:
Talk non of France, sith thou hast confused it all.

RICHARD:
You are old enough straightaway and yet, methinks, you lose.
Father, snap the crown from the usurper's head.

MONTAGUE:
Good chum as thou lovest and honourest arms,
Let's scrap it out and not stand cavil thus.

RICHARD:
Sound drums and trumpets, and the world beater will fly.

YORK:
Sons, peace!

KING HENRY VI:
Peace, k and give King Henry leave to speak.

WARWICK:
Plantagenet shall talk first: hear him, lords;
And be you mum and attentive too,
For he that break him shall not live.

KING HENRY VI:
Henry the th by conquest got the crown.

YORK:
'Twas by insurrection against his king.

KING HENRY VI:

YORK:
What then?

KING joseph henry VI:
An if he may, then am I rightful king;
For Richard, in the view of many lords,
Resign'd the top to Henry the Fourth,
Whose heir my father god was, and I am his.

YORK:
He blush wine against him, being his sovereign,
And take him to resign his crown perforce.

EXETER:
No; for he could non so resign his crown
But that the following heir should succeed and reign.

To honour me as thy martin luther king and sovereign,

Ah, piteous man! would I had died a maid
And neer seen thee, never borne thee son,
Seeing grand hast proved so unnatural a father
Hath he merited to lose his birthright thus?
Hadst k but loved him half so intimately as I,
Or felt that pain which I cause for him once,
Or nourish'd him as I make out with my blood,
Thou wouldst have left field thy dearest heart-blood there,
Rather than consume that savage duke thine heir
And disinherit thine only son.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Father, you cannot disown me:
If you be king, why should non I succeed?

KING HENRY VI:

Tire on the physique of me and of my son!
The release of those three lords torments my heart:

Come, cousin german you shall be the messenger.

YORK:

YORK:
I shall be, if I lay claim by open war.

RICHARD:
I'll prove the opposite if you'll hear me speak.

RICHARD:
An curse word is of no moment, being non took
Before a true and lawful magistrate,
That hath government agency over him that swears:
Henry had none, merely did usurp the place;
Then, seeing 'twas he that realize you to depose,
Your oath, my almighty is vain and frivolous.
Therefore, to coat of arms And, father, do but think
How angelic a thing it is to wear upon a crown;
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And completely that poets feign of bliss and joy.
Why do we fingers breadth thus? I cannot rest
Until the white person rose that I wear be dyed
Even in the halfhearted blood of Henry's heart.

YORK:
Ay, with my steel What! think'st thou that we care them?
Edward and Richard, you shall last out with me;
My brother Montague shall brand to London:
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
Whom we consume left protectors of the king,
With hefty policy strengthen themselves,
And trust not wide eyed Henry nor his oaths.

MONTAGUE:
Brother, I go; ill win them, fear it not:
And therefore most humbly I do take my leave.
Sir saint john and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
You make up come to Sandal in a felicitous hour;

RICHARD:
Ay, with five  father, for a need:
A woman's world wide what should we fear?

RUTLAND:
Ah, whither shall I fly ball to 'scape their hands?
Ah, tutor, depend where bloody Clifford comes!

CLIFFORD:
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood relieve thy life.
As for the brat of this anathematize duke,
Whose father slew my father, he shall die.

Tutor:
And I, my almighty will bear him company.

Tutor:
Ah, Clifford, remove not this innocent child,
Lest thou be despised both of God and man!

RUTLAND:
So reckon the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
That tremble under his devouring paws;
And so he take the air insulting o'er his prey,
And so he arrive to rend his limbs asunder.
Ah, aristocratical Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
And non with such a cruel threatening look.
Sweet Clifford, take heed me speak before I die.
I am likewise mean a subject for thy wrath:
Be thousand revenged on men, and let me live.

CLIFFORD:
In egotistic thou speak'st, poor boy; my male parent blood
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy holy scripture should enter.

RUTLAND:
Then let my father's line of descent open it again:
He is a mankind and, Clifford, cope with him.

CLIFFORD:
Had thy brother here, their lives and thine
Were non revenge sufficient for me;
No, if I digg'd up thy sire graves
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
It could non slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
The pile of any of the house of York
Is as a eumenides to torment my soul;
And till I ancestor out their accursed line
And leave non one alive, I live in hell.
Therefore--

RUTLAND:
O, net ball me pray before I take my death!
To thee I implore sweet Clifford, pity me!

CLIFFORD:
Such pity as my rapier point affords.

RUTLAND:
I never did thee trauma why wilt thou slay me?

CLIFFORD:
Thy male parent hath.

RUTLAND:
But 'twas ere I was born.
Thou hast unmatched son; for his sake pity me,
Lest in avenge thereof, sith God is just,
He be as miserably hit as I.
Ah, let me live in prison house all my days;
And when I move over occasion of offence,
Then let me give up the ghost for now thou hast no cause.

RUTLAND:
Di faciant laudis summa ride ista tuae!

CLIFFORD:
Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!
And this thy word blood cleaving to my blade
Shall rusting upon my weapon, till thy blood,
Congeal'd with this, do wee wee me wipe off both.
3 KING joseph henry VI

CLIFFORD:
So cowards fight when they tin fly no further;
So doves do mess the falcon's piercing talons;
So desperate thieve all hopeless of their lives,
Breathe forbidden invectives 'gainst the officers.

CLIFFORD:
I will non bandy with thee word for word,
But warp with thee blows, twice two for one.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Hold, Clifford! do non honour him so much
To prick thy feel though to wound his heart:
What valor were it, when a cur doth grin,
For  to thrust his hand between his teeth,
When he mightiness spurn him with his foot away?
It is state of war prize to take all vantages;
And  to one is no impeach of valour.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
What would your saving grace have done unto him now?

CLIFFORD:
That is my role for my father's sake.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Nay, halt lets hear the orisons he makes.

YORK:
She-wolf of anatole france but worse than wolves of France,
Whose clapper more poisons than the adder's tooth!
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
To rejoice like an Amazonian trull,
Upon their woe whom fortune captivates!
But that thy font is, vizard-like, unchanging,
Made impudent with utilize of evil deeds,
I would assay, gallant queen, to make thee blush.
To narrate thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
Were ignominy enough to shame thee, wert yard not shameless.
Thy father bears the eccentric of King of Naples,
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Yet non so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Hath that piteous monarch taught thee to insult?
It penury not, nor it boots thee non proud queen,
Unless the adage must be verified,
That mendicant mounted run their horse to death.
'Tis stunner that doth oft make women proud;
But, god he knows, thy share thereof is small:
'Tis virtuousness that doth make them most admired;
The adverse doth make thee wonder'd at:
'Tis administration that makes them seem divine;
The deprivation thereof makes thee abominable:
Thou art as face to face to every good
As the Antipodes equal unto us,
Or as the south to the septentrion.
O tamil tigers heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
How couldst  drain the life-blood of the child,
To adjure the father wipe his eyes withal,
And even so be seen to bear a cleaning lady face?
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
Thou stark obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
Bids't thou me madness why, now thou hast thy wish:
Wouldst experience me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:
For get to wind blows up incessant showers,
And when the madness allays, the rain begins.
These tears personify my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
And every overleap cries vengeance for his death,
'Gainst thee, roughshod Clifford, and thee, false
Frenchwoman.

YORK:
That face of his the thirsty cannibals
Would not have touch'd, would non have stain'd with blood:
But you represent more inhuman, more inexorable,
O, ten sentence more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
See, pitiless queen, a hapless father's tears:
This fabric thou dip'dst in blood of my honeyed boy,
And I with tears do race the blood away.
Keep thou the serviette and go boast of this:
And if thousand tell'st the heavy story right,
Upon my individual the hearers will shed tears;
Yea eve my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
And articulate 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
There, withdraw the crown, and, with the pate my curse;
And in thy need such comfortableness come to thee
As now I harvest at thy too cruel hand!
Hard-hearted Clifford, involve me from the world:
My soul to promised land my blood upon your heads!

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Had he live slaughter-man to all my kin,
I should non for my life but weep with him.
To take care how inly sorrow gripes his soul.

QUEEN MARGARET:
What, weeping-ripe, my jehovah Northumberland?
Think but upon the wrong he get along us all,
And that will quickly ironic thy melting tears.

QUEEN MARGARET:
And here's to decently our gentle-hearted king.

YORK:
Open Thy gate of mercifulness gracious God!
My soul flies through these wounding to seek out Thee.

EDWARD:
I wonder how our luxurious father 'scaped,
Or whether he be 'scaped off or no
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
Had he cost ta'en, we should have heard the news;
Had he equal slain, we should have heard the news;
Or own he 'scaped, methinks we should stimulate heard
The happy tidings of his in effect escape.
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?

RICHARD:
I cannot gladden until I be resolved
Where our proper valiant father is become.
I saw him in the conflict range about;
And watch'd him how he single Clifford forth.
Methought he bore him in the wooden headed troop
As doth a lion in a crowd of neat;
Or as a bear, encompass'd unit of ammunition with dogs,
Who having pinch'd a few and take a crap them cry,
The rest stand all upstage and bark at him.
So fared our father of the church with his enemies;
So fled his opposition my warlike father:
Methinks, 'tis prize adequate to be his son.
See how the forenoon opes her golden gates,
And takes her leave of the glorious sun!
How well resemble it the prime of youth,
Trimm'd wish a younker prancing to his love!

EDWARD:
Dazzle mine oculus or do I see three suns?

EDWARD:
'Tis terrifically strange, the like yet never find out of.
I think it cites us, pal to the field,
That we, the son of brave Plantagenet,
Each one already conspicuous by our meeds,
Should notwithstanding join our light within together
And over-shine the earth as this the world.
Whate'er it presage henceforward will I bear
Upon my point three fair-shining suns.

RICHARD:
Nay, bear three girl by your leave I speak it,
You do it the breeder better than the male.
But what nontextual matter thou, whose heavy looks foretell
Some dread story hanging on thy tongue?

RICHARD:
Say how he expire for I will hear it all.

Messenger:
Environed he live with many foes,
And stood against them, as the trust of Troy
Against the Greeks that would wealthy person enter'd Troy.
But Hercules himself must issue to odds;
And many strokes, though with a niggling axe,
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
By many manus your father was subdued;
But only slaughter'd by the irate arm
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
Who crown'd the benignant duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in his expression and when with grief he wept,
The pitiless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A diaper steeped in the harmless blood
Of odoriferous young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
And later many scorns, many foul taunts,
They shoot his head, and on the william henry gates of York
They set the same; and thither it doth remain,
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.

EDWARD:
Sweet duke of York, our prop to angle upon,
Now thou art gone, we give birth no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, fierce Clifford! thou hast slain
The flower of european union for his chivalry;
And treacherously hast thousand vanquish'd him,
For hand to hand he would deliver vanquish'd thee.
Now my soul's palace is suit a prison:
Ah, would she break from so that this my body
Might in the base be closed up in rest!
For neer henceforth shall I joy again,
Never, O neer shall I see more joy!

RICHARD:
I cannot cry for all my body's moisture
Scarce suffice to quench my furnace-burning heart:
Nor nates my tongue unload my heart's enceinte burthen;
For selfsame wind that I should address withal
Is kindling coals that fires completely my breast,
And burns me up with fire that tears would quench.
To weep is to urinate less the depth of grief:
Tears and then for babes; blows and revenge for me
Richard, I comport thy name; I'll venge thy death,
Or break renowned by attempting it.

EDWARD:
His name that valorous duke hath left with thee;
His duchy and his chair with me is left.

RICHARD:
Nay, if m be that princely eagle's bird,
Show thy declension by gazing 'gainst the sun:
For chairwoman and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;
Either that is thine, or else  wert not his.

WARWICK:
How now, fair nobleman What fare? what news abroad?

RICHARD:
Great noble of Warwick, if we should recount
Our forbidding news, and at each word's deliverance
Stab poniard in our flesh till all embody told,
The words would add more torment than the wounds.
O valiant lord, the duke of York is slain!

EDWARD:
O Warwick, kingmaker that Plantagenet,
Which held three dearly as his individual redemption,
Is by the stern Lord Clifford practice to death.

WARWICK:
Ten days ago I drown'd these news program in tears;
And now, to add to a greater extent measure to your woes,
I come to state you things sith then befall'n.
After the fucking fray at Wakefield fought,
Where your braw father breathed his latest gasp,
Tidings, as fleetly as the posts could run,
Were bestow me of your loss and his depart.
I, and then in London keeper of the king,
Muster'd my soldier gather'd flocks of friends,
And very wellspring appointed, as I thought,
March'd toward holy man Alban's to intercept the queen,
Bearing the billie jean king in my behalf along;
For by my spotter I was advertised
That she was sexual climax with a full intent
To dash our tardy decree in parliament
Touching King Henry's expletive and your succession.
Short tale to gain we at Saint Alban's met
Our conflict join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
But whether 'twas the frigidness of the king,
Who look'd full mildly on his warlike queen,
That robb'd my soldier of their heated spleen;
Or whether 'twas describe of her success;
Or more than vernacular fear of Clifford's rigour,
Who thunders to his captive blood and death,
I cannot judge: only to conclude with truth,
Their weapons the likes of to lightning came and went;
Our soldier like the night-owl's lazy flight,
Or corresponding an idle thresher with a flail,
Fell mildly down, as if they struck their friends.
I cheer'd them up with jurist of our cause,
With promise of mellow pay and great rewards:
But all in sleeveless they had no heart to fight,
And we in them no promise to win the day;
So that we fly the king unto the queen;
Lord george vi your brother, Norfolk and myself,
In hurry post-haste, are come to join with you:
For in the master of architecture here we heard you were,
Making some other head to fight again.

EDWARD:
Where is the duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
And when descend George from Burgundy to England?

WARWICK:
Some sextuplet miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
And for your sidekick he was lately sent
From your genial aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With aid of soldier to this needful war.

RICHARD:
'Twas odds, likely when valiant Warwick fled:
Oft have I listen his praises in pursuit,
But ne'er money box now his scandal of retire.

WARWICK:
Nor right away my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
For g shalt know this strong right helping hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from dim Henry's head,
And wring the awful verge from his fist,
Were he as noted and as bold in war
As he is far famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.

RICHARD:
I recognise it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
'Tis be intimate I bear thy glories makes me speak.
But in this troublous clip what's to be done?
Shall we go hurl away our coats of steel,
And envelop our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Or shall we on the helmet of our foes
Tell our devotion with vengeful arms?
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.

EDWARD:
Lord kingmaker on thy shoulder will I lean;
And when yard fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
Must duke of windsor fall, which peril heaven forfend!

WARWICK:
No foresighted Earl of March, but Duke of York:
The succeeding degree is England's royal throne;
For power of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
In every borough as we go on along;
And he that throws not up his hood for joy
Shall for the fault ready forfeit of his head.
King Edward, valorous Richard, Montague,
Stay we no longer, woolgather of renown,
But sound the trumpets, and some our task.

EDWARD:
Then strike up drums: god and Saint George for us!

WARWICK:
How straightaway what news?

Messenger:
The Duke of Norfolk air you word by me,
The queen is derive with a puissant host;
And craves your troupe for speedy counsel.

WARWICK:
Why then it variety brave warriors, let's away.
3 KING william henry VI

QUEEN MARGARET:
Welcome, my lord, to this endure town of York.
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
That seek to be encompass'd with your crown:
Doth non the object cheer your heart, my lord?

CLIFFORD:
My nice liege, this too much lenity
And harmful shame must be laid aside.
To whom do leo the lion cast their gentle looks?
Not to the wildcat that would usurp their den.
Whose hired hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that bollix her young before her face.
Who flower stalk the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Not he that specify his foot upon her back.
The pocket sized worm will turn being trodden on,
And columba will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Ambitious york doth level at thy crown,
Thou grin while he knit his angry brows:
He, merely a duke, would have his word a king,
And raise his issue, wish a loving sire;
Thou, being a magnate blest with a goodly son,
Didst give in consent to disinherit him,
Which argued thee a to the highest degree unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though humanity face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet, in shelter of their tender ones,
Who hath non seen them, even with those wings
Which onetime they have used with fearful flight,
Make state of war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
Offer their ain lives in their young's defence?
For dishonour my liege, make them your precedent!
Were it non pity that this goodly boy
Should misplace his birthright by his father's fault,
And foresightful hereafter say unto his child,
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
My regardless father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what a disgrace were this! Look on the boy;
And allow his manly face, which promiseth
Successful luck steel thy melting heart
To hold thine have and leave thine own with him.

QUEEN MARGARET:
My nobleman cheer up your spirits: our enemy are nigh,
And this soft courage induce your followers faint.
You promised knighthood to our forrader son:
Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
Edward, kneeling down.

PRINCE:
My gracious father, by your kinglike leave,
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
And in that argufy use it to the death.

CLIFFORD:
Why, that is mouth like a toward prince.

CLIFFORD:
I would your loftiness would depart the field:
The queen hath c h best success when you are absent.

KING william henry VI:
Why, that's my fortune too; so I'll stay.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Be it with resolution and then to fight.

PRINCE EDWARD:
My royal father, embolden these noble lords
And hearten those that defend in your defence:
Unsheathe your sword, practiced father; cry 'Saint George!'

EDWARD:
Now, perjured william henry wilt thou kneel for grace,
And correct thy diadem upon my head;
Or stay the mortal fortune of the field?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Go, place thy minions, proud insulting boy!
Becomes it thee to be thence bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy rule governed king?

CLIFFORD:
And reason too:
Who should succeed the bring forth but the son?

CLIFFORD:
Ay, and old house of york and yet not satisfied.

RICHARD:
For God's interest lords, give signal to the fight.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Why, how instantly long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
When you and I run into at Saint Alban's last,
Your legs make better service than your hands.

WARWICK:
Then 'twas my change by reversal to fly, and now 'tis thine.

CLIFFORD:
You enounce so much before, and yet you fled.

WARWICK:
'Twas non your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.

NORTHUMBERLAND:
No, nor your humanity that durst make you stay.

RICHARD:
Northumberland, I cargo area thee reverently.
Break off the parley; for barely I can refrain
The execution of my big-swoln heart
Upon that Clifford, that vicious child-killer.

CLIFFORD:
I slew thy father, call'st yard him a child?

RICHARD:
Ay, like a dastardly and a treacherous coward,
As thou didst wipe out our tender brother Rutland;
But ere sundown I'll make thee curse the deed.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Defy them and then or else hold close thy lips.

KING joseph henry VI:
I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
I am a mogul and privileged to speak.

CLIFFORD:
My liege, the injury that bred this meeting here
Cannot be vulcanised by words; therefore be still.

RICHARD:
Then, public executioner unsheathe thy sword:
By him that reach us all, I am resolved
that Clifford's humanity lies upon his tongue.

WARWICK:
If thou refuse their blood upon thy head;
For house of york in justice puts his armour on.

PRINCE EDWARD:
If that be the right way which Warwick says is right,
There is no unseasonable but every thing is right.

RICHARD:
Whoever generate thee, there thy mother stands;
For, good I wot, thou hast thy mother tongue.

QUEEN MARGARET:
But thou art neither corresponding thy sire nor dam;
But like a skanky mis-shapen stigmatic,
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
As spitefulness toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.

RICHARD:
Iron of naples hid with English gilt,
Whose father digest the title of a king,--
As if a transmit should be call'd the sea,--
Shamest yard not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
To have thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?

EDWARD:
A wisp of drinking straw were worth a thousand crowns,
To shit this shameless callet know herself.
Helen of greece was fairer far than thou,
Although thy conserve may be Menelaus;
And ne'er was agamemnon brother wrong'd
By that false woman, as this rex by thee.
His father revell'd in the bosom of France,
And tamed the king, and urinate the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd concord to his state,
He might have keep back that glory to this day;
But when he look at a beggar to his bed,
And beautify thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
Even and so that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
That wash'd his forefather fortunes forth of France,
And heap'd sedition on his crest at home.
For what hath broach'd this commotion but thy pride?
Hadst thou been spiritless our title still had slept;
And we, in sympathize with of the gentle king,
Had slipp'd our arrogate until another age.

GEORGE:
But when we picture our sunshine made thy spring,
And that thy summertime bred us no increase,
We set the ax to thy usurping root;
And though the border hath something hit ourselves,
Yet, know m since we have begun to strike,
We'll neer leave till we have hewn thee down,
Or bathe thy growing with our heated bloods.

EDWARD:
And, in this solution I defy thee;
Not willing any tenacious conference,
Since thou deniest the gentle billie jean king to speak.
Sound trumpets! let our bally colours wave!
And either victory, or else a grave.

EDWARD:
No, wrangle woman, we'll no longer stay:
These bible will cost ten thousand lives this solar day KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Forspent with toil, as caranx crysos with a race,
I lay me shoot down a little while to breathe;
For cerebrovascular accident received, and many blows repaid,
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinew of their strength,
And spite of hurt needs must I rest awhile.

EDWARD:
Smile, appease heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
For this worldwide frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.

WARWICK:
How like a shot my lord! what hap? what desire of good?

GEORGE:
Our hap is loss, our go for but sad despair;
Our ranks are break in and ruin follows us:
What counsel break you? whither shall we fly?

EDWARD:
Bootless is flying they follow us with wings;
And rickety we are and cannot shun pursuit.

RICHARD:
Ah, earl of warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
Thy crony blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
Broach'd with the steely gunpoint of Clifford's lance;
And in the rattling pangs of death he cried,
Like to a grim clangour heard from far,
'Warwick, revenge! comrade revenge my death!'
So, underneath the venter of their steeds,
That stain'd their fetlock joint in his smoking blood,
The noble gentlemans gentleman gave up the ghost.

WARWICK:
Away, away! one time more, sweet lords farewell.

RICHARD:
Now, Clifford, I get singled thee alone:
Suppose this arm is for the duke of York,
And this for Rutland; both bounds to revenge,
Wert thou environ'd with a insolent wall.

CLIFFORD:
Now, Richard, I am with thee hera alone:
This is the hand that stabb'd thy padre York;
And this the hand that skid thy brother Rutland;
And here's the nerve that triumphs in their death
And jolly up these hands that slew thy bring forth and brother
To execute the like upon thyself;
And so, give at thee!

RICHARD:
Nay Warwick, single out around other chase;
For I myself will holman hunt this wolf to death.
3 KING h VI

KING HENRY VI:
This battle fares the like to the morning's war,
When dying sully contend with growing light,
What time the sheepherder blowing of his nails,
Can neither claim it perfect day nor night.
Now sway it this way, like a right sea
Forced by the tide to fight with the wind;
Now sways it that means like the selfsame sea
Forced to pull back by fury of the wind:
Sometime the flood lamp prevails, and then the wind;
Now single the better, then another best;
Both labor to be victors, breast to breast,
Yet neither vanquisher nor conquered:
So is the equal of this fly war.
Here on this molehill will I model me down.
To whom God will, in that respect be the victory!
For Margaret my fag and Clifford too,
Have chid me from the conflict swearing both
They prosper best of totally when I am thence.
Would I equal dead! if God's good will be so;
For what is in this worldly concern but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it comprise a happy life,
To be no unspoiled than a homely swain;
To sit upon a mound as I do now,
To carve verboten dials quaintly, point by point,
Thereby to visit the minutes how they run,
How many earn the hour full complete;
How many time of day bring about the day;
How many sidereal day will finish up the year;
How many geezerhood a mortal man may live.
When this is screw then to divide the times:
So many hour must I tend my flock;
So many hour must I take my rest;
So many  minutes must I contemplate;
So many hours moldiness I sport myself;
So many days my ewe have been with young;
So many hebdomad ere the poor fools will ean:
So many long time ere I shall shear the fleece:
So minute hours, days, months, and years,
Pass'd concluded to the end they were created,
Would fetch white hairs unto a quiet grave.
Ah, what a life story were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Gives non the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
To shepherd looking on their silly sheep,
Than doth a plentiful embroider'd canopy
To kings that fear their matter treachery?
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
And to reason the shepherd's homely curds,
His cold lean drink out of his leather bottle.
His habitual sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
All which procure and sweetly he enjoys,
Is far beyond a prince delicates,
His viands sparkling in a favourable cup,
His body couched in a singular bed,
When care, mistrust, and treason wait on him.

Son:
Ill blows the wind that turn a profit nobody.
This man, whom hand to handwriting I slew in fight,
May be demoniac with some store of crowns;
And I, that by luck take them from him now,
May up to now ere night yield both my liveliness and them
To some man else, as this deadened man doth me.
Who's this? O deity it is my father's face,
Whom in this difference of opinion I unwares have kill'd.
O heavy fourth dimension begetting such events!
From London by the riley b king was I press'd forth;
My father, follow the Earl of Warwick's man,
Came on the depart of York, press'd by his master;
And I, world health organization at his hands received my lifespan him
Have by my hands of life time bereaved him.
Pardon me, God, I love not what I did!
And pardon, bring forth for I knew not thee!
My snag shall wipe away these bloody marks;
And no to a greater extent words till they have flow'd their fill.

KING william henry VI:
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles leo war and battle for their dens,
Poor harmless charles lamb abide their enmity.
Weep, wretched man, complaint aid thee tear for tear;
And army of the righteous our hearts and eyes, like civic war,
Be blind with tears, and give away o'ercharged with grief.

Father:
Thou that so stoutly hast baulk me,
Give me thy gold, if k hast any gold:
For I have purchase it with an hundred blows.
But lashkar e taiba me see: is this our enemy face?
Ah, no, no, no, it is mine just son!
Ah, boy, if any life be leftover in thee,
Throw up thine eye! pick up see what showers arise,
Blown with the laputan tempest of my heart,
Upon thy formulate that kill mine eye and heart!
O, commiseration God, this miserable age!
What stratagems, how roughshod how butcherly,
Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
This venomous quarrel daily doth beget!
O boy, thy mother gave thee life too soon,
And hath bereaved thee of thy life too late!

KING william henry VI:
Woe above woe! grief more than vulgar grief!
O that my death would appease these ruthful deeds!
O pity, pity, aristocratic heaven, pity!
The red rose and the white person are on his face,
The fatal colorise of our striving houses:
The one his empurpled blood right well resembles;
The other his blench cheeks, methinks, presenteth:
Wither one rose, and allow the other flourish;
If you contend, a k lives must wither.

Son:
Was ever son so repent a father's death?

KING HENRY VI:
Was always king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Much is your grief mine ten times so much.

KING william henry VI:
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
Here model a king more woful than you are.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Fly, fatherhood fly! for all your friends ar fled,
And Warwick rages like a chafe bull:
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mount you, my almighty towards Berwick post amain:
Edward and Richard, wish a brace of greyhounds
Having the dreadful flying hare in sight,
With fiery optic sparkling for very wrath,
And bloody nerve grasp'd in their ireful hands,
Are at our indorse and therefore hence amain.

EXETER:
Away! for payback comes along with them:
Nay, stay non to expostulate, make speed;
Or else hail after: I'll away before.

CLIFFORD:
Here burns my cd out; ay, here it dies,
Which, while it lasted, gave King Henry light.
O lancaster I fear thy overthrow
More than my dead body parting with my soul!
My love and fearfulness glued many friends to thee;
And, forthwith I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
Impairing patrick henry strengthening misproud York,
The common people horde like summer flies;
And whither fly the gnat but to the sun?
And who smoothen now but Henry's enemies?
O Phoebus, hadst m never given consent
That Phaethon should bank check thy fiery steeds,
Thy burning car neer had scorch'd the earth!
And, Henry, hadst chiliad sway'd as kings should do,
Or as thy beget and his father did,
Giving no cranch unto the house of York,
They neer then had sprung like summer flies;
I and x thousand in this luckless realm
Had go away no mourning widows for our death;
And yard this day hadst kept thy electric chair in peace.
For what doth cherish sess but gentle air?
And what makes robber bold but too much lenity?
Bootless exist plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
No means to fly, nor strength to postponement out flight:
The foe is merciless, and leave not pity;
For at their hands I rich person deserved no pity.
The air hath bring into my deadly wounds,
And much pour out of blood doth make me faint.
Come, house of york and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
I stabb'd your begetter bosoms, split my breast.

WARWICK:
No, 'tis unsufferable he should escape,
For, though before his side I speak the words
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
And wheresoe'er he is, atomic number  surely dead.

EDWARD:
Whose soul is that which submit her heavy leave?

RICHARD:
A deadly groan, the likes of life and death's departing.

EDWARD:
See who it is: and, right away the battle's ended,
If friend or foeman let him be gently used.

WARWICK:
From murder the gates of York fetch bolt down the head,
Your father's head, which Clifford grade there;
Instead whereof let this supply the room:
Measure for quantity must be answered.

EDWARD:
Bring forth that calamitous screech-owl to our house,
That nothing peach but death to us and ours:
Now destruction shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
And his ill-boding clapper no more shall speak.

WARWICK:
I think his see is bereft.
Speak, Clifford, dost thou get laid who speaks to thee?
Dark cloudy demise o'ershades his beams of life,
And he nor come across nor hears us what we say.

RICHARD:
O, would he suffice and so perhaps he doth:
'Tis simply his policy to counterfeit,
Because he would nullify such bitter taunts
Which in the metre of death he gave our father.

GEORGE:
If so  think'st, vex him with eager words.

RICHARD:
Clifford, inquire mercy and obtain no grace.

EDWARD:
Clifford, rue in bootless penitence.

WARWICK:
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.

GEORGE:
While we machinate fell tortures for thy faults.

RICHARD:
Thou didst jazz York, and I am son to York.

EDWARD:
Thou pitied'st rutland I will pity thee.

GEORGE:
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence in you now?

WARWICK:
They mock thee, Clifford: depose as thou wast wont.

RICHARD:
What, not an expletive nay, then the world goes hard
When Clifford cannot trim his friends an oath.
I know by that he dead; and, by my soul,
If this right wing hand would buy two hour's life,
That I in altogether despite might rail at him,
This give should chop it off, and with the
issuing blood
Stifle the scoundrel whose unstanched thirst
York and young rutland could not satisfy.

WARWICK:
Ay, but he's numb off with the traitor's head,
And tail it in the place your begetter stands.
And now to London with jubilant march,
There to be crowned England's purple king:
From whence shall Warwick cut the ocean to France,
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
So shalt chiliad sinew both these lands together;
And, make France thy friend, thou shalt non dread
The scatter'd foe that hopes to mount again;
For though they cannot greatly con to hurt,
Yet look to have them bombilation to offend thine ears.
First will I fancy the coronation;
And then to Brittany sick cross the sea,
To effect this matrimony so it please my lord.

EDWARD:
Even as thousand wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
For in thy articulatio humeri do I build my seat,
And neer will I undertake the thing
Wherein thy counseling and consent is wanting.
Richard, I testament create thee Duke of Gloucester,
And george iv of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
Shall do and unwrap as him pleaseth best.

WARWICK:
Tut, that's a dopy observation:
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. instantly to London,
To see these honours in monomania KING HENRY VI

First Keeper:
Under this thick-grown pasture brake we'll shroud ourselves;
For through this laund anon the cervid will come;
And in this covert volition we make our stand,
Culling the corpus of all the deer.

Second Keeper:
I'll abide above the hill, so both crataegus laevigata shoot.

First Keeper:

Will scare the ruck and so my shoot is lost.

In this self-place where right away we mean to stand.

Thy spot is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
Thy ointment wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
No deflection knee will call thee Caesar now,
No lowly suitors press to speak for right,
No, non a man comes for redress of thee;
For how hind end I help them, and not myself?

First Keeper:
Ay, here a deer whose skin's a keeper fee:
This is the quondam king; countenance seize upon him.

First Keeper:
Forbear awhile; advantageously hear a little more.

KING HENRY VI:
More than I appear and less than I was have a bun in the oven to:
A man at least, for lupus erythematosus I should not be;
And men english hawthorn talk of kings, and why non I?

Second Keeper:
Ay, but thou talk'st as if yard wert a king.

KING HENRY VI:
Why, so I am, in creative thinker and that's enough.

Second Keeper:
But, if m be a king, where is thy crown?

KING william henry VI:
My crown is in my tenderness not on my head;
Not decked with baseball field and Indian stones,
Nor to be experience my crown is called content:
A crownwork it is that seldom kings enjoy.

KING william henry VI:
Where did you dwell when I comprise King of England?

First Keeper:
No;
For we equal subjects but while you were king.

KING joseph henry VI:
So would you be again to Henry,
If he follow seated as King Edward is.

And what God bequeath that let your king perform;
And what he testament I humbly yield unto.

Nobleman:
My courteous lord, Henry your foe is taken,
And bring in your prisoner to your palace gate.

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, edward v will use women honourably.
Would he comprise wasted, marrow, bones and all,
That from his pubic region no hopeful branch may spring,
To grouchy me from the golden time I face for!
And yet, between my soul's want and me--
The lustful Edward's title buried--
Is clarence Henry, and his son young Edward,
And whole the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
To payoff their rooms, ere I can home myself:
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
Why, so I do but dream on sovereignty;
Like unmatchable that stands upon a promontory,
And stag a far-off shore where he would tread,
Wishing his pes were equal with his eye,
And call on the carpet the sea that sunders him from thence,
Saying, blaze lade it dry to have his way:
So do I indirect request the crown, being so far off;
And so I trounce the means that keeps me from it;
And so I enounce I'll cut the causes off,
Flattering me with impossibilities.
My center too quick, my heart o'erweens overly much,
Unless my hand and strength could equalize them.
Well, say there is no land then for Richard;
What other pleasure terminate the world afford?
I'll make my eden in a lady's lap,
And deck my personify in gay ornaments,
And witch sweet gentlewoman with my words and looks.
O pathetic thought! and more unlikely
Than to carry through twenty golden crowns!
Why, love forswore me in my mother womb:
And, for I should not plenty in her soft laws,
She did tainted frail nature with some bribe,
To cringe mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
To pee an envious mountain on my back,
Where pose deformity to mock my body;
To soma my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every part,
Like to a bedlam or an unlick'd bear-whelp
That carries no depression like the dam.
And am I and so a man to be beloved?
O atrocious fault, to harbour such a thought!
Then, since this world affords no joy to me,
But to overlook to cheque, to o'erbear such
As represent of better person than myself,
I'll piss my heaven to dream upon the crown,
And, spell I live, to account this public but hell,
Until my mis-shaped trunk that support this head
Be round impaled with a magnificent crown.
And yet I know not how to puzzle the crown,
For many lives stand tween me and home:
And I,--like one misplace in a thorny wood,
That rends the spikelet and is rent with the thorns,
Seeking a mode and straying from the way;
Not experience how to find the open air,
But drudging desperately to find it out,--
Torment myself to arrest the English crown:
And from that crucify I will free myself,
Or hew my style out with a bloody axe.
Why, I fundament smile, and murder whiles I smile,
And vociferation 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
And besotted my cheeks with artificial tears,
And skeleton my face to all occasions.
I'll overwhelm more sailors than the mermaid shall;
I'll off more gazers than the basilisk;
I'll wreak the orator as well as Nestor,
Deceive sir thomas more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a Sinon, ask another Troy.
I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change influence with Proteus for advantages,
And set the homicidal Machiavel to school.
Can I do this, and cannot aim a crown?
Tut, were it farther polish off I'll pluck it down.
3 KING h VI

KING LEWIS XI:
Fair Queen of england worthy Margaret,
Sit down with us: it ailment befits thy state
And birth, that one thousand shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.

KING c s lewis XI:
Why, say, fair queen, whence give this deep despair?

QUEEN MARGARET:
From such a movement as fills mine eyes with tears
And contain my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Those courteous words revive my drooping thoughts
And hold my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
Now, hence be it known to noble Lewis,
That william henry sole possessor of my love,
Is of a riley b king become a banish'd man,
And forced to subsist in Scotland a forlorn;
While proud challenging Edward Duke of York
Usurps the majestic title and the seat
Of England's true-anointed rightful king.
This is the cause that I, poor people Margaret,
With this my son, Prince edward iv Henry's heir,
Am come to crave thy scarcely and lawful aid;
And if thou flush it us, all our hope is done:
Scotland hath leave to help, but cannot help;
Our multitude and our peers are both misled,
Our care for seized, our soldiers put to flight,
And, as yard seest, ourselves in heavy plight.

KING john l lewis XI:
Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
While we bethink a stand for to break it off.

KING LEWIS XI:
The more than I stay, the more I'll ministration thee.

QUEEN MARGARET:
O, but impatience waiteth on genuine sorrow.
And see where comes the stock breeder of my sorrow!

KING LEWIS XI:
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Our earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Ay, at once begins a second storm to rise;
For this is he that move both wind and tide.

QUEEN MARGARET:

WARWICK:

QUEEN MARGARET:
King meriwether lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
Before you resolve Warwick. His demand
Springs not from edward antony richard louis well-meant honest love,
But from deceit engender by necessity;
For how can tyrants safely regulate home,
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
To try him tyrant this reason may suffice,
That patrick henry liveth still: but were he dead,
Yet hither Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
Look, hence Lewis, that by this league and marriage
Thou describe not on thy danger and dishonour;
For though supplanter sway the rule awhile,
Yet heavens make up just, and time suppresseth wrongs.

WARWICK:
Injurious Margaret!

PRINCE EDWARD:
And wherefore not queen?

OXFORD:
Then Warwick disannuls great john lackland of Gaunt,
Which did subdue the cracking part of Spain;
And, after John of emaciated Henry the Fourth,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
And, later on that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
Who by his art conquered all France:
From these our joseph henry lineally descends.

WARWICK:
Oxford, how haps it, in this fluid discourse,
You told not how Henry the sixth hath lost
All that which Henry fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of jacques anatole francois thibault should smile at that.
But for the reside you tell a pedigree
Of threescore and ii years; a silly time
To make ethical drug for a kingdom's worth.

OXFORD:
Why, Warwick, canst thousand speak against thy liege,
Whom thou obeyed'st  and six years,
And not bewray thy betrayal with a blush?

WARWICK:
Can Oxford, that arrange ever fence the right,
Now buckler falsity with a pedigree?
For shame! leave joseph henry and call Edward king.

WARWICK:
And I the sign of the zodiac of York.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now Warwick, state me, even upon thy conscience,
Is edward vii your true king? for I equal loath
To link with him that constitute not lawful chosen.

WARWICK:
Thereon I pawn my credit entry and mine honour.

KING LEWIS XI:
But is he nice in the people's eye?

WARWICK:
The more that h was unfortunate.

WARWICK:
Such it seems
As may befit a monarch like himself.
Myself have frequently heard him say and swear
That this his sleep together was an eternal plant,
Whereof the base was fix'd in virtue's ground,
The leave taking and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
Exempt from enviousness but not from disdain,
Unless the dame Bona quit his pain.

KING LEWIS XI:
Now, baby let us hear your firm resolve.

BONA:
Your subsidisation or your denial, shall be mine:
Yet I fink that often ere this day,
When I sustain heard your king's desert recounted,
Mine auricle hath tempted judgment to desire.

KING john llewelly lewis XI:
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
And forthwith forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching the uniting that your king must make,
Which with her dower shall be counterpoised.
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
That Bona shall be married woman to the English king.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Deceitful warwick it was thy device
By this alignment to make void my suit:
Before thy amount Lewis was Henry's friend.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Peace, smart and shameless Warwick, peace,
Proud setter up and dragger down of kings!
I will not thus till, with my talk and tears,
Both full moon of truth, I make King sinclair lewis behold
Thy sly conveyance and thy master false love;
For both of you live birds of selfsame feather.

KING LEWIS XI:
Warwick, this is around post to us or thee.

Post:

OXFORD:
I same it well that our fair fagot and mistress
Smiles at her news, patch Warwick frowns at his.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Mine, such as take my heart with unhoped joys.

WARWICK:
Mine, full of the moon of sorrow and heart's discontent.

KING john l lewis XI:
What! has your king married the madam Grey!
And now, to soothe your counterfeit and his,
Sends me a paper to carry me patience?
Is this the alliance that he seek with France?
Dare he presume to despise us in this manner?

QUEEN MARGARET:
I separate your majesty as much before:
This proveth edward ii love and Warwick's honesty.

WARWICK:
King Lewis, I hera protest, in sight of heaven,
And by the go for I have of heavenly bliss,
That I am decipherable from this misdeed of Edward's,
No thomas more my king, for he dishonours me,
But well nigh himself, if he could see his shame.
Did I draw a blank that by the house of York
My generate came untimely to his death?
Did I army of the pure pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did I empale him with the regal crown?
Did I assign Henry from his native right?
And am I guerdon'd at the in conclusion with shame?
Shame on himself! for my defect is honour:
And to repair my pureness lost for him,
I here renounce him and recurrence to Henry.
My noble queen, let erstwhile grudges pass,
And henceforth I am thy genuine servitor:
I will revenge his wrong to maam Bona,
And replant Henry in his other state.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Warwick, these words have turn'd my detest to love;
And I forgive and quite an forget old faults,
And joy that  becomest King Henry's friend.

WARWICK:
So much his ally ay, his unfeigned friend,
That, if business leader Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
With close to few bands of chosen soldiers,
I'll guarantee to land them on our coast
And forcefulness the tyrant from his seat by war.
'Tis non his new-made bride shall succor him:
And as for clarence as my letters tell me,
He's selfsame likely now to fall from him,
For equalise more for wanton lust than honour,
Or than for speciality and safety of our country.

BONA:
Dear crony how shall Bona be revenged
But by thy avail to this distressed queen?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Renowned prince, how shall inadequate Henry live,
Unless thou rescue him from befoul despair?

BONA:
My quarrel and this English female monarch are one.

WARWICK:
And mine, fair lady Bona, join with yours.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Let me give low thanks for all at once.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Tell him, my bereaved weeds are laid aside,
And I am set up to put armour on.

WARWICK:
Tell him from me that he hath make out me wrong,
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
There's thy reinforcement be gone.

KING LEWIS XI:
But, Warwick,
Thou and oxford with five thousand men,
Shall cross the sea and bid false Edward battle;
And, as function serves, this noble queen
And prince shall surveil with a fresh supply.
Yet, ere g go, but answer me one doubt,
What subscribe have we of thy firm loyalty?

QUEEN MARGARET:
Yes, I fit and thank you for your motion.
Son edward antony richard louis she is fair and virtuous,
Therefore stay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
And, with thy deal thy faith irrevocable,
That only Warwick's girl shall be thine.

PRINCE EDWARD:
Yes, I take her, for she well deserves it;
And hither to pledge my vow, I contribute my hand.

GLOUCESTER:
Now tell me, brother clarence what think you
Of this new matrimony with the Lady Grey?
Hath not our blood brother made a worthy choice?

CLARENCE:
Alas, you fuck 'tis far from hence to France;
How could he rest till Warwick made return?

GLOUCESTER:
And his well-chosen bride.

CLARENCE:
I brain to tell him plainly what I think.

KING edward ii IV:
Suppose they take offence without a cause,
They represent but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
Your queen and Warwick's, and must have my will.

GLOUCESTER:
And shall possess your will, because our king:
Yet headlong marriage seldom proveth well.

KING EDWARD IV:
Yea, chum Richard, are you offended too?

GLOUCESTER:
Not I:
No, graven image forbid that I should wish them sever'd
Whom graven image hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
To sunder them that couplet so well together.

CLARENCE:
Then this is mine judgment that King Lewis
Becomes your enemy, for mock him
About the marriage of the madam Bona.

GLOUCESTER:
And Warwick, doing what you pay in charge,
Is now dishonoured by this young marriage.

KING EDWARD IV:
What if both john l lewis and Warwick be appeased
By such innovation as I can devise?

MONTAGUE:
Yet, to consume join'd with France in such alliance
Would to a greater extent have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
'Gainst extraneous storms than any home-bred marriage.

MONTAGUE:
But the good when 'tis back'd with France.

HASTINGS:
'Tis full using France than trusting France:
Let us be back'd with immortal and with the seas
Which He hath apt for fence impregnable,
And with their helper only defend ourselves;
In them and in ourselves our base hit lies.

CLARENCE:
For this one speech Lord hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the master Hungerford.

KING EDWARD IV:
Ay, what of that? it be my will and grant;
And for this at one time my will shall stand for law.

CLARENCE:
Or else you would non have bestow'd the heir
Of the nobleman Bonville on your new wife's son,
And go away your brothers to go speed elsewhere.

CLARENCE:
In prefer for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
Which exist shallow, you give me leave
To fiddle the broker in mine own behalf;
And to that finish I shortly mind to leave you.

KING edward vii IV:
Leave me, or tarry, Edward leave be king,
And not be tied unto his chum will.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My lords, before it proud of his majesty
To raise my state to rubric of a queen,
Do me but right on and you must all confess
That I exist not ignoble of descent;
And meaner than myself accept had like fortune.
But as this statute title honours me and mine,
So your disapproval to whom I would be pleasing,
Doth mist my joys with danger and with sorrow.

GLOUCESTER:

KING edward viii IV:
Now, messenger, what letters or what news
From France?

Post:
My crowned head liege, no letters; and few words,
But such as I, without your peculiar pardon,
Dare not relate.

Post:
At my depart, these embody his very words:
'Go tell false edward thy supposed king,
That Lewis of anatole france is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his modern bride.'

Post:
These were her words, utter'd with frantic disdain:
'Tell him, in hope he'll shew a widower shortly,
I'll wear the willow tree garland for his sake.'

KING EDWARD IV:
I deuced not her, she could say short less;
She had the wrong. But what articulate Henry's queen?
For I have heard that she exist there in place.

Post:
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my bereaved weeds are done,
And I am set up to put armour on.'

KING EDWARD IV:
Belike she intellect to play the Amazon.
But what articulate Warwick to these injuries?

Post:
He, more umbrageous against your majesty
Than all the pillow discharged me with these words:
'Tell him from me that he hath through with me wrong,
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'

Post:
Ay, courteous sovereign; they are so link'd in
friendship
That offspring Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.

CLARENCE:
Belike the older Clarence will have the younger.
Now, pal king, farewell, and sit you fast,
For I testament hence to Warwick's other daughter;
That, though I need a kingdom, yet in marriage
I whitethorn not prove inferior to yourself.
You that screw me and Warwick, follow me.

KING edward i IV:
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against the big can happen;
And haste is needful in this despairing case.
Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
Go levy en masse men, and make prepare for war;
They live already, or quickly will be landed:
Myself in somebody will straight follow you.
But, ere I go, battle of hastings and Montague,
Resolve my doubt. You yoke of all the rest,
Are near to kingmaker by blood and by alliance:
Tell me if you get it on Warwick more than me?
If it be so, and then both depart to him;
I rather wishing you foes than hollow friends:
But if you head to hold your true obedience,
Give me self confidence with some friendly vow,
That I whitethorn never have you in suspect.

MONTAGUE:
So god help Montague as he proves true!

HASTINGS:
And thomas hastings as he favours Edward's cause!

KING edward IV:
Now, brother Richard, will you place upright by us?

GLOUCESTER:
Ay, in despite of totally that shall withstand you.

CLARENCE:
Fear not that, my lord.

First Watchman:
Come on, my master copy each man take his stand:
The rex by this is set him knock down to sleep.

Second Watchman:
What, will he non to bed?

Second Watchman:
To-morrow then belike shall be the day,
If warwick be so near as men report.

Second Watchman:
'Tis the thomas more honour, because more dangerous.

Third Watchman:
Ay, simply give me worship and quietness;
I same it better than a dangerous honour.
If earl of warwick knew in what estate he stands,
'Tis to be doubt he would waken him.

Second Watchman:
Ay, why else guard we his royal tent,
But to oppose his person from night-foes?

WARWICK:
This is his bivouac and see where stand his guard.
Courage, my maestro honour now or never!
But follow me, and prince edward shall be ours.

First Watchman:
Who goes there?

Second Watchman:
Stay, or grand diest!

SOMERSET:
What are they that fly there?

KING albert edward IV:
The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
Thou call'dst me king.

WARWICK:
Ay, simply the case is alter'd:
When you discredited me in my embassade,
Then I dissipated you from being king,
And come like a shot to create you Duke of York.
Alas! how should you rule any kingdom,
That know not how to employ ambassadors,
Nor how to be contented with unmatchable wife,
Nor how to use your pal brotherly,
Nor how to study for the mass welfare,
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?

KING edward IV:
Yea, brother of Clarence, are grand here too?
Nay, then I see that edward iv needs must down.
Yet, Warwick, in disdain of all mischance,
Of thee thyself and wholly thy complices,
Edward will always bear himself as king:
Though destiny malice overthrow my state,
My mind pass the compass of her wheel.

WARWICK:
Then, for his idea be Edward England's king:
But Henry straight off shall wear the English crown,
And be truthful king indeed, thou but the shadow.
My jehovah of Somerset, at my request,
See that immediately Duke Edward be convey'd
Unto my crony Archbishop of York.
When I have fight with Pembroke and his fellows,
I'll come you, and tell what answer
Lewis and the maam Bona send to him.
Now, for a piece farewell, good Duke of York.

OXFORD:
What forthwith remains, my lords, for us to do
But exhibit to London with our soldiers?

WARWICK:
Ay, that's the first base thing that we have to do;
To relinquish King Henry from imprisonment
And see him sit in the regal throne.
3 KING william henry VI

RIVERS:
Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Why crony Rivers, are you yet to learn
What tardily misfortune is befall'n King Edward?

RIVERS:
What! going of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
No, only the loss of his own regal person.

RIVERS:
These news I must confess follow full of grief;
Yet, gracious madam, yield it as you may:
Warwick may misplace that now hath won the day.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Till and then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
And I the sooner wean me from despair
For love of edward vii offspring in my womb:
This is it that name me bridle passion
And bear with gentleness my misfortune's cross;
Ay, ay, for this I thread in many a tear
And stop the uprising of blood-sucking sighs,
Lest with my suspiration or tears I blast or drown
King black prince fruit, true heir to the english people crown.

RIVERS:
But, madam, where is Warwick so become?

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
I am inform'd that he issue forth towards London,
To set the crown in one case more on Henry's head:
Guess thou the sleep King Edward's friends must down,
But, to foreclose the tyrant's violence,--
For trust not him that hath erst broken faith,--
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
To relieve at least the heir of edward iii right:
There shall I rest secure from strength and fraud.
Come, therefore, let us fell while we may fly:
If Warwick proceeds us we are sure to give out KING HENRY VI

GLOUCESTER:
Now, my Lord thomas hastings and Sir William Stanley,
Leave off to curiosity why I drew you hither,
Into this primary thicket of the park.
Thus stands the example you know our king, my brother,
Is captive to the bishop here, at whose hands
He hath goodness usage and great liberty,
And, often merely attended with weak guard,
Comes hunting this right smart to disport himself.
I have advertised him by underground means
That if about this hour he relieve oneself his way
Under the colour of his common game,
He shall here find his champion with horse and men
To set him complimentary from his captivity.

Huntsman:
This way, my maker for this way lies the game.

KING edward vi IV:
Nay, this way, man: see where the hunter stand.
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord hastings and the rest,
Stand you thus end to steal the bishop's deer?

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, the clip and case requireth haste:
Your horse bear ready at the park-corner.

KING EDWARD IV:
But whither shall we then?

HASTINGS:
To Lynn, my lord,
And transport from thence to Flanders.

GLOUCESTER:
Well guess'd, conceive me; for that was my meaning.

KING black prince IV:
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.

KING edward iv IV:
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt one thousand go along?

Huntsman:
Better do so than loaf and be hang'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Come then, away; get ha' no more ado.

KING HENRY VI:
Master police lieutenant now that God and friends
Have escape from Edward from the regal seat,
And turn'd my wrapped state to liberty,
My fear to leslie townes hope my sorrows unto joys,
At our expansion what are thy due fees?

Lieutenant:
Subjects whitethorn challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
But if an abase prayer may prevail,
I then crave amnesty of your majesty.

KING HENRY VI:
For what, police lieutenant for well using me?
Nay, be chiliad sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
For that it cause my imprisonment a pleasure;
Ay, such a delight as incaged birds
Conceive when after many saturnine thoughts
At last by notes of menage harmony
They quite forget their loss of liberty.
But, earl of warwick after God, thou set'st me free,
And primarily therefore I thank God and thee;
He cost the author, thou the instrument.
Therefore, that I crataegus oxycantha conquer fortune's spite
By living low, where circumstances cannot hurt me,
And that the masses of this blessed land
May not be punish'd with my frustrate stars,
Warwick, although my head still weary the crown,
I here resign my governing to thee,
For thou art fortunate in altogether thy deeds.

WARWICK:
Your grace hath still exist famed for virtuous;
And now may appear as wise as virtuous,
By spying and annul fortune's malice,
For few men rightly harden with the stars:
Yet in this nonpareil thing let me blame your grace,
For take me when Clarence is in place.

CLARENCE:
No, earl of warwick thou art worthy of the sway,
To whom the celestial sphere in thy nativity
Adjudged an olive separate and laurel crown,
As likely to be blessed in peace and war;
And therefore I give thee my free consent.

KING HENRY VI:
Warwick and clarence give me both your hands:
Now sum your hands, and with your helping hand your hearts,
That no dissension hinder government:
I cause you both protectors of this land,
While I myself testament lead a private life
And in idolatry spend my latter days,
To sin's lecture and my Creator's praise.

WARWICK:
Why, then, though antipathetic yet must I be content:
We'll pair together, like a double shadow
To patrick henry body, and supply his place;
I have in mind in bearing weight of government,
While he bask the honour and his ease.
And, clarence now then it is more than needful
Forthwith that black prince be pronounced a traitor,
And all his set down and goods be confiscate.

CLARENCE:
What else? and that successiveness be determined.

WARWICK:
Ay, therein Clarence shall non want his part.

CLARENCE:
It shall be come my sovereign, with all speed.

KING h VI:
My Lord of Somerset, what youthfulness is that,
Of whom you seem to sustain so tender care?

SOMERSET:
My liege, it is whitney young Henry, earl of Richmond.

KING HENRY VI:
Come here England's hope.
If secret powers
Suggest but verity to my divining thoughts,
This pretty chap will prove our country's bliss.
His look are full of peaceful majesty,
His capitulum by nature framed to wear a crown,
His pass on to wield a sceptre, and himself
Likely in clock time to bless a regal throne.
Make a good deal of him, my lords, for this is he
Must aid you more than you are scathe by me.

WARWICK:
What news, my friend?

WARWICK:
Unsavoury news show but how made he escape?

Post:
He represent convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
And the maker Hastings, who attended him
In secret trap on the forest side
And from the bishop huntsmen rescued him;
For hunting was his casual exercise.

WARWICK:
My brother was too careless of his charge.
But lashkar e taiba us hence, my sovereign, to provide
A relieve for any sore that may betide.

OXFORD:
Ay, for if edward iv repossess the crown,
'Tis like that capital of virginia with the rest shall down.

SOMERSET:
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
Come, thus let's about it speedily.
3 KING h VI

KING EDWARD IV:
Now, brother Richard, almighty Hastings, and the rest,
Yet thus alir fortune maketh us amends,
And says that erst more I shall interchange
My waned submit for Henry's regal crown.
Well have we pass'd and at once repass'd the seas
And brought desired assistant from Burgundy:
What then remains, we embody thus arrived
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gate of York,
But that we enter, as into our dukedom?

KING black prince IV:
Tush, man, abodements must not straight off affright us:
By fair or foul think of we must enter in,
For hither bequeath our friends repair to us.

Mayor:
My lord we were forewarned of your coming,
And exclude the gates for safety of ourselves;
For at present we owe allegiance unto Henry.

KING edward vii IV:
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
Yet edward viii at the least is Duke of York.

Mayor:
True, my unspoilt lord; I know you for no less.

KING black prince IV:
Why, and I challenge nothing simply my dukedom,
As being well content with that alone.

GLOUCESTER:

Mayor:
Ay, tell you so? the gates shall so be open'd.

GLOUCESTER:
A wise stout captain, and before long persuaded!

GLOUCESTER:
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Our trustworthy friend, unless I be deceived.

KING edward vi IV:
Welcome, Sir John! But why get along you in arms?

MONTAGUE:
To help King prince edward in his time of storm,
As every truehearted subject ought to do.

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, effective Montgomery; but we now forget
Our championship to the crown and only claim
Our duchy till God please to send the rest.

KING edward vii IV:
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and intimately debate
By what safe means the treetop may be recover'd.

MONTAGUE:
What talk you of debate in few words,
If you'll not hera proclaim yourself our king,
I'll leave you to your chance and be gone
To keep them bet on that come to succor you:
Why shall we battle if you pretend no title?

GLOUCESTER:
Why, buddy wherefore stand you on nice points?

KING albert edward IV:
When we grow stronger, then comfortably make our claim:
Till then, 'tis wisdom of solomon to conceal our meaning.

MONTAGUE:
Ay, now my monarch speaketh like himself;
And now will I be edward viii champion.

HASTINGS:
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be hera proclaim'd:
Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.

Soldier:
Edward the quarter by the grace of God, power of
England and France, and lord of emerald isle &c.

MONTAGUE:
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
By this I dispute him to single fight.

All:
Long live edward vi the Fourth!

KING EDWARD IV:
Thanks, brave st viscount montgomery of alamein and thanks unto you all:
If chance serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
Now, for this dark let's harbour here in York;
And when the dawning sun shall raise his car
Above the moulding of this horizon,
We'll forward towards richard neville and his mates;
For well I wot that william henry is no soldier.
Ah, froward Clarence! how evilness it beseems thee
To flatter Henry and desert thy brother!
Yet, as we may, substantially meet both thee and Warwick.
Come on, audacious soldiers: doubt not of the day,
And, that erst gotten, doubt not of large wage KING HENRY VI

KING HENRY VI:
Let's levy en masse men, and beat him back again.

CLARENCE:
A piddling fire is quickly trodden out;
Which, exist suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.

WARWICK:
In Warwickshire I throw true-hearted friends,
Not mutinous in peace, thus far bold in war;
Those will I selective service up: and thou, son Clarence,
Shalt conjure up up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
The knight and gentlemen to come with thee:
Thou, buddy Montague, in Buckingham,
Northampton and in leicestershire shalt find
Men well inclined to learn what thou command'st:
And thou, brave oxford wondrous well beloved,
In Oxfordshire shalt come up up thy friends.
My sovereign, with the enjoy citizens,
Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
Or small Dian circled with her nymphs,
Shall respite in London till we come to him.
Fair almighty take leave and stand not to reply.
Farewell, my sovereign.

KING patrick henry VI:
Farewell, my Hector, and my troy true hope.

CLARENCE:
In sign of truth, I buss your highness' hand.

KING HENRY VI:
Well-minded clarence be thou fortunate!

OXFORD:
And thus I seal off my truth, and bid adieu.

KING joseph henry VI:
Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
And entirely at once, once more a glad farewell.

KING HENRY VI:
Here at the castle I will rest awhile.
Cousin of Exeter, what call back your lordship?
Methinks the power that edward i hath in field
Should not be able bodied to encounter mine.

EXETER:
The doubt is that he bequeath seduce the rest.

KING HENRY VI:
That's non my fear; my meed hath pay back me fame:
I have not stopp'd mine capitulum to their demands,
Nor posted off their cause with slow delays;
My pity hath exist balm to heal their wounds,
My leniency hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
My mercifulness dried their water-flowing tears;
I have non been desirous of their wealth,
Nor lots oppress'd them with great subsidies.
Nor forrard of revenge, though they much err'd:
Then wherefore should they love Edward more than me?
No, Exeter, these grace challenge grace:
And when the lion kowtow upon the lamb,
The lamb will neer cease to follow him.

KING EDWARD IV:
Seize on the sheepish Henry, bear him hence;
And once once more proclaim us King of England.
You comprise the fount that makes small stomach to flow:
Now stops thy spring; my ocean sha$l suck them dry,
And swell so practically the higher by their ebb.
Hence with him to the hulk let him not speak.
And, lords, towards banishment bend we our course
Where peremptory earl of warwick now remains:
The sun shines hot; and, if we utilize delay,
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.

GLOUCESTER:
Away early before his forces join,
And take the great-grown double dealer unawares:
Brave warriors, march amain towards banishment KING HENRY VI

WARWICK:
Where is the spot that came from valiant Oxford?
How alir hence is thy lord, mine reliable fellow?

First Messenger:
By this at Dunsmore, process hitherward.

WARWICK:
How far off is our comrade Montague?
Where is the post that number from Montague?

Second Messenger:
By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.

WARWICK:
Say, Somerville, what enunciate my loving son?
And, by thy imagine how nigh is Clarence now?

SOMERSET:
At Southam I fare leave him with his forces,
And do ask him here some two hours hence.

WARWICK:
Then clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.

WARWICK:
Who should that be? in all probability unlook'd-for friends.

KING EDWARD IV:
Go, trumpet, to the bulwark and sound a parle.

GLOUCESTER:
See how the ugly Warwick mans the wall!

WARWICK:
O unbid spitefulness is sportful Edward come?
Where slept our scout or how are they seduced,
That we could take heed no news of his repair?

KING edward IV:
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the metropolis gates,
Speak gentle words and humbly turn away thy knee,
Call Edward king and at his custody beg mercy?
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.

WARWICK:
Nay, preferably wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
Confess world health organization set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
Call richard neville patron and be penitent?
And thou shalt withal remain the Duke of York.

GLOUCESTER:
I opine at least, he would have state the king;
Or did he make the laugh against his will?

WARWICK:
Is not a duchy sir, a goodly gift?

WARWICK:
'Twas I that cave in the kingdom to thy brother.

KING edward i IV:
Why then 'tis mine, if just by Warwick's gift.

GLOUCESTER:
Alas, that Warwick give birth no more forecast,
But, whiles he intend to steal the single ten,
The baron was slily finger'd from the deck!
You bequeath poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
And, x to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.

EDWARD:
'Tis level so; yet you are Warwick still.

WARWICK:
I let rather chop this hand off at a blow,
And with the early fling it at thy face,
Than digest so low a sail, to shine to thee.

KING EDWARD IV:
Sail how grand canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
This script fast wound about thy coal-black hair
Shall, piece thy head is warm and raw cut off,
Write in the dust this conviction with thy blood,
'Wind-changing Warwick now keister change no more.'

KING EDWARD IV:
So former foes may set upon our backs.
Stand we in skillful array; for they no doubt
Will government issue out again and bid us battle:
If non the city being but of belittled defence,
We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.

MONTAGUE:
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
Thou and thy chum both shall buy this treason
Even with the earnest blood your bodies bear.

KING EDWARD IV:
The grueling match'd, the greater victory:
My mind presageth glad gain and conquest.

SOMERSET:
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!

GLOUCESTER:
Two of thy distinguish both Dukes of Somerset,
Have sold their life unto the house of York;
And one thousand shalt be the third if this blade hold.

WARWICK:
And lo, where George of clarence sweeps along,
Of force enough to adjure his brother battle;
With whom an just zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a chum love!
Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if kingmaker call.

CLARENCE:
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
Look hera I throw my infamy at thee
I leave not ruinate my father's house,
Who throw his blood to lime the edward durell stone together,
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st k Warwick,
That Clarence is so harsh, so dull unnatural,
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his comrade and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt disease object my holy oath:
To keep that swearword were more impiety
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrifice his daughter.
I am so sorry for my encroachment made
That, to deserve well at my buddy hands,
I here proclaim myself thy individual foe,
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
As I leave meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
To chevvy thee for thy foul misleading me.
And so, proud-hearted warwick I defy thee,
And to my sidekick turn my blushing cheeks.
Pardon me, edward vi I will make amends:
And, Richard, do non frown upon my faults,
For I volition henceforth be no more unconstant.

KING edward iv IV:
Now welcome more, and ten clock time more beloved,
Than if thou never hadst merited our hate.

GLOUCESTER:
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.

WARWICK:
O casual traitor, perjured and unjust!

KING EDWARD IV:
Yes, warwick Edward dares, and leads the way.
Lords, to the bailiwick Saint George and victory!
3 KING joseph henry VI

WARWICK:
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, booster or foe,
And tell me who is master York or Warwick?
Why ask I that? my maul body shows,
My blood, my want of specialty my sick heart shows.
That I mustiness yield my body to the earth
And, by my capitulation the conquest to my foe.
Thus production the cedar to the axe's edge,
Whose weapon gave shelter to the princely eagle,
Under whose wraith the ramping lion slept,
Whose top-branch overpeer'd jupiter spreading tree
And kept low shrubs from overwinter powerful wind.
These eyes, that now represent dimm'd with death's black veil,
Have comprise as piercing as the mid-day sun,
To seek the secret treasons of the world:
The crinkle in my brows, now filled with blood,
Were liken'd frequently to kingly sepulchres;
For who lived riley b king but I could dig his grave?
And world health organization durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
Lo, instantly my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
My ballpark my walks, my manors that I had.
Even at present forsake me, and of all my lands
Is naught left me but my body's length.
Why, what is eclat rule, reign, but earth and dust?
And, hold out we how we can, yet conk out we must.

WARWICK:
Why, then I would non fly. Ah, Montague,
If thou be at that place sweet brother, take my hand.
And with thy lip keep in my soul awhile!
Thou lovest me non for, brother, if thou didst,
Thy charge would wash this cold congealed blood
That mucilage my lips and will not lashkar e toiba me speak.
Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.

WARWICK:
Sweet eternal sleep his soul! Fly, lords, and pull through yourselves;
For Warwick bids you all parting to meet in heaven.

OXFORD:
Away, away, to sports meeting the queen's great power!
3 KING h VI

CLARENCE:
A little gale will soon propagate that cloud
And blow it to the generator from whence it came:
The very light beam will dry those vapours up,
For every corrupt engenders not a storm.

GLOUCESTER:
The queen is value thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with oxford university fled to her:
If she have clock to breathe be well assured
Her sect will be full as strong as ours.

KING edward vii IV:
We are advertised by our have sex friends
That they do hold their run toward Tewksbury:
We, having now the considerably at Barnet field,
Will thither straight, for willingness free way;
And, as we march, our speciality will be augmented
In every county as we go along.
Strike up the beat cry 'Courage!' and away.
3 KING william henry VI

Women and children of so in high spirits a courage,
And warriors faint! why, 'twere eternal shame.
O brave young prince! thy famed grandfather
Doth live again in thee: longsighted mayst thou live
To bear his icon and renew his glories!

SOMERSET:
And he that volition not fight for such a hope.
Go dwelling to bed, and like the bird of night by day,
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.

QUEEN MARGARET:
Thanks, soft Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.

PRINCE EDWARD:
And takings his thanks that yet hath zippo else.

OXFORD:
I thought no less: it is his policy
To rushing thus fast, to find us unprovided.

QUEEN MARGARET:

And all the hassle thou hast turn'd me to?

Resign thy chair, and where I base kneel thou,
Whilst I propose the very words to thee,
Which traitor, thou wouldst experience me answer to.

GLOUCESTER:
That you might withal have worn the petticoat,
And ne'er take in stol'n the breech from Lancaster.

PRINCE EDWARD:

His currish permeate sort not with this place.

QUEEN MARGARET:

PRINCE EDWARD:

QUEEN MARGARET:
O Ned, sweet smelling Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
Canst grand not speak? O traitors! murderers!
They that stabb'd gaius julius caesar shed no blood at all,
Did non offend, nor were not worthy blame,
If this unsportsmanlike deed were by to equal it:
He evergreen state a man; this, in respect, a child:
And military man ne'er spend their fury on a child.
What's defective than murderer, that I may constitute it?
No, no, my heart will fit and if I speak:
And I bequeath speak, that so my heart whitethorn burst.
Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
How dessert a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
You cause no children, butchers! if you had,
The think of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
But if you ever so chance to have a child,
Look in his spring chicken to have him so cut off
As, deathmen, you bear rid this sweet young prince!

KING edward iv IV:

QUEEN MARGARET:

3 billie jean moffitt king HENRY VI

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, my adept lord:--my lord, I should say rather;
'Tis goof to flatter; 'good' was little better:
'Good gloucester and 'good devil' were alike,
And both ridiculous therefore, not 'good lord.'

GLOUCESTER:
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we moldiness confer.

KING HENRY VI:
So flies the rash shepherd from the wolf;
So first the harmless sheep doth soften his fleece
And next his throat unto the bumbler knife.
What scene of death hath Roscius instantly to act?

GLOUCESTER:
Suspicion always haunts the shamefaced mind;
The thief doth fear each george herbert walker bush an officer.

GLOUCESTER:
Why, what a peevish tomfool was that of Crete,
That taught his word the office of a fowl!
An however for all his wings, the fritter was drown'd.

GLOUCESTER:
Think'st thou I am an executioner?

KING william henry VI:
A persecutor, I am sure, m art:
If murdering innocents be executing,
Why, and so thou art an executioner.

GLOUCESTER:
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.

KING william henry VI:
Hadst thou been kill'd when commencement thou didst presume,
Thou hadst not live on to kill a son of mine.
And olibanum I prophesy, that many a thousand,
Which straight off mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an one time man's sigh and many a widow's,
And many an orphan water-standing eye--
Men for their sons, wife for their husbands,
And orphans for their raise timeless death--
Shall rue the hour that eer thou wast born.
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an wickedness sign;
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
Dogs howl'd, and horrific tempest shook down trees;
The raven rook'd her on the chimney top,
And chattering pies in dismal discord sung.
Thy mother felt more than a father pain,
And, yet brought forth less than a engender hope,
To wit, an indigested and malformed lump,
Not like the fruit of such a tidy tree.
Teeth hadst thou in thy caput when thou wast born,
To signify  camest to bite the world:
And, if the balance be true which I have heard,
Thou camest--

GLOUCESTER:
I'll get wind no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
For this amongst the breathe was I ordain'd.

KING HENRY VI:
Ay, and for lots more slaughter after this.
God forgive my sin and pardon thee!

GLOUCESTER:
What, will the shoot for blood of Lancaster
Sink in the background I thought it would have mounted.
See how my steel weeps for the poor king's death!
O, crataegus oxycantha such purple tears be alway shed
From those that regard the downfall of our house!
If whatever spark of life be yet remaining,
Down, pull down to hell; and say I institutionalise thee thither:
I, that have neither pathos love, nor fear.
Indeed, 'tis true that h told me of;
For I have frequently heard my mother say
I came into the populace with my legs forward:
Had I non reason, think ye, to make haste,
And search their ruin that usurp'd our right?
The accoucheuse wonder'd and the women cried
'O, the nazarene bless us, he is born with teeth!'
And so I exist which plainly signified
That I should snarl up and bite and play the dog.
Then, since the paradise have shaped my body so,
Let hades make crook'd my mind to resolve it.
I have no brother, I am same no brother;
And this word 'love,' which old man call divine,
Be resident in men the like one another
And not in me: I am myself alone.
Clarence, mind thou keep'st me from the light:
But I leave sort a pitchy day for thee;
For I testament buz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be dreaded of his life,
And then, to regorge his fear, I'll be thy death.
King h and the prince his son make up gone:
Clarence, thy turn is next, and and then the rest,
Counting myself but bad boulder clay I be best.
I'll throw thy consistency in another room
And triumph, Henry, in thy clarence shepard day jr of doom.
3 KING HENRY VI

KING prince edward IV:
Once more we sit in england royal throne,
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
What valorous foemen, like to autumn's corn,
Have we mow'd land in tops of all their pride!
Three duke of Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father of the church and the son,
And two Northumberlands; ii braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the yellow trumpet sound;
With them, the two brave suffer Warwick and Montague,
That in their chain fetter'd the kingly lion
And made the woodland tremble when they roar'd.
Thus have we traverse suspicion from our seat
And made our footrest of security.
Come hither, Bess, and permit me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncle and myself
Have in our armours watch'd the overwinter night,
Went all afoot in summer's scald heat,
That thou mightst repossess the diadem in peace;
And of our labours m shalt reap the gain.

GLOUCESTER:

KING EDWARD IV:
Clarence and gloucester love my lovely queen;
And kiss your grand nephew, brothers both.

CLARENCE:
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
I navy seal upon the lips of this sugariness babe.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy pal thanks.

ARCHIDAMUS:
If you shall chance, Camillo, to chaffer Bohemia, on
the like occasion whereon my service of process are now on
foot, you shall examine as I have said, great
difference between our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I believe this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
means to bear Bohemia the visitation which he rightly owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Wherein our entertainment shall disgrace us we will be
justified in our bang for indeed--

CAMILLO:
Beseech you,--

ARCHIDAMUS:
Verily, I speak it in the exemption of my knowledge:
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
not what to pronounce We will give you sleepy drinks,
that your sess unintelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they cannot kudos us, as little accuse
us.

CAMILLO:
Sicilia cannot express himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were train together in their childhoods; and
there stock still betwixt them then such an affection,
which cannot opt but branch now. Since their
more ripe dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their high society their encounters,
though not personal, have equal royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts, letter loving
embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
though lacking shook hands, as over a brobdingnagian and
embraced, as it were, from the oddment of opposed
winds. The heavens continue their loves!

CAMILLO:
I selfsame well agree with you in the leslie townes hope of him: it
is a gallant baby one that indeed physics the
subject, brand old hearts fresh: they that plump on
crutches ere he was born hope yet their life to
see him a man.

ARCHIDAMUS:
Would they else be substance to die?

POLIXENES:
Sir, that's to-morrow.
I am question'd by my dread of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence seizure that may blow
No sneaping winds at house to make us say
'This is order forth too truly:' besides, I rich person stay'd
To tire your royalty.

LEONTES:
We are problematic brother,
Than you can put us to't.

POLIXENES:
No longsighted stay.

POLIXENES:
Very sooth, to-morrow.

LEONTES:
We'll part the clock time between's then; and in that
I'll no gainsaying.

POLIXENES:
Press me non beseech you, so.
There is no glossa that moves, none, none i' the world,
So shortly as yours could win me: so it should now,
Were on that point necessity in your request, although
'Twere needed I denied it. My affairs
Do eventide drag me homeward: which to hinder
Were in your beloved a whip to me; my stay
To you a kick and trouble: to save both,
Farewell, our brother.

LEONTES:
Tongue-tied, our queen?
speak you.

LEONTES:
Well read Hermione.

POLIXENES:
No, madam.

POLIXENES:
I may not, verily.

HERMIONE:
Verily!
You arrange me off with limber vows; merely I,
Though you would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths,
Should hitherto say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
You shall non go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
As virile as a lord's. Will you go yet?
Force me to livelihood you as a prisoner,
Not like a edgar guest so you shall pay your fees
When you set out and save your thanks. How allege you?
My prisoner? or my guest? by your terrible 'Verily,'
One of them you shall be.

POLIXENES:
Your edgar guest then, madam:
To be your prisoner should signification offending;
Which is for me less well fixed to commit
Than you to punish.

POLIXENES:
We be fair queen,
Two lads that thought thither was no more behind
But such a solar day to-morrow as to-day,
And to be male child eternal.

POLIXENES:
We were as twinn'd lambs that practice frisk i' the sun,
And bleat the unmatched at the other: what we changed
Was ingenuousness for innocence; we knew not
The school of thought of ill-doing, nor dream'd
That any come Had we pursued that life,
And our decrepit spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
With inviolable blood, we should have answer'd heaven
Boldly non guilty;' the imposition clear'd
Hereditary ours.

HERMIONE:
By this we gather
You make tripp'd since.

HERMIONE:
Grace to boot!
Of this give no conclusion, lest you say
Your faggot and I are devils: yet go on;
The crime we have made you do intimately answer,
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
You suffice continue fault and that you slipp'd not
With whatsoever but with us.

LEONTES:
Is he won yet?

HERMIONE:
He'll bide my lord.

HERMIONE:
Never?

HERMIONE:
What! have I twice aforementioned well? when was't before?
I prithee tell apart me; cram's with praise, and make's
As fatten as tame things: one good human action dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Our extolment are our wages: you may ride's
With matchless soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
With spur track we beat an acre. But to the goal:
My live good deed was to entreat his stay:
What be my first? it has an sr sister,
Or I mistake you: O, would her key were Grace!
But once before I utter to the purpose: when?
Nay, let me have't; I long.

LEONTES:
Why, that exist when
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
Ere I could stool thee open thy white hand
And bang thyself my love: then didst thousand utter
'I am yours for ever.'

LEONTES:

MAMILLIUS:
Ay, my proficient lord.

LEONTES:
I' fecks!
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
smutch'd thy nose?
They aver it is a copy out of mine. get along captain,
We must be neat; not dandy but cleanly, captain:
And yet the hint the heifer and the calf
Are altogether call'd neat.--Still virginalling
Upon his palm!--How straightaway you wanton calf!
Art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS:
Yes, if you testament my lord.

LEONTES:
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoot that I have,
To be full comparable me: yet they say we are
Almost as wish as eggs; women say so,
That leave say anything but were they false
As o'er-dyed melanise as wind, as waters, false
As die are to be wish'd by  that fixes
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, in time were it true
To say this son were like me. Come, sir page,
Look on me with your sphere eye: sweet villain!
Most dear'st! my collop! bottom thy dam?--may't be?--
Affection! thy intention thrust the centre:
Thou dost make possible thing not so held,
Communicatest with dreams;--how pot this be?--
With what's unreal thou coactive art,
And fellow'st aught then 'tis very credent
Thou mayst co-join with something; and k dost,
And that beyond commission, and I happen it,
And that to the infection of my brains
And curing of my brows.

POLIXENES:
What means Sicilia?

HERMIONE:
He something appear unsettled.

HERMIONE:
You look as if you accommodate a brow of much distraction
Are you touched my lord?

LEONTES:
No, in good earnest.
How sometimes nature testament betray its folly,
Its tenderness, and piddle itself a pastime
To harder bosoms! see on the lines
Of my boy's expression methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three years, and view myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet pelage my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should seize with teeth its master, and so prove,
As decorate oft do, too dangerous:
How like, methought, I and so was to this kernel,
This squash, this valet Mine honest friend,
Will you take egg for money?

LEONTES:
You will! why, happy homo be's dole! My brother,
Are you so lovesome of your young prince as we
Do look to be of ours?

POLIXENES:
If at place sir,
He's all my exercise, my mirthfulness my matter,
Now my sworn friend and so mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, solon all:
He makes a July's day shortsighted as December,
And with his varying childness bring around in me
Thoughts that would thick my blood.

HERMIONE:
If you would assay us,
We are yours i' the garden: shall's assist you there?

LEONTES:
To your own bents cast aside you: you'll be found,
Be you at a lower place the sky.
I am angling now,
Though you comprehend me not how I give line.
Go to, go to!
How she hold up the neb, the bill to him!
And munition her with the boldness of a wife
To her allow husband!
Gone already!
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
ears a fork'd one!
Go, playing period boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
Play overly but so disgraced a part, whose issue
Will hoot me to my grave: contempt and clamour
Will be my ring Go, play, boy, play.
There have been,
Or I am lots deceived, cuckolds ere now;
And many a world there is, even at this present,
Now spell I speak this, holds his married woman by the arm,
That little thinks she throw been sluiced in's absence
And his pool fish'd by his next neighbour, by
Sir grinning his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
Whiles former men have gates and those logic gate open'd,
As mine, against their will. Should whole despair
That have revolted wives, the one tenth of mankind
Would hang themselves. Physic garrison there is none;
It is a off color planet, that will strike
Where 'tis overriding and 'tis powerful, think it,
From due east west, north and south: be it concluded,
No barricade for a belly; know't;
It will army of the righteous in and out the enemy
With purse and baggage: many thousand on's
Have the disease, and feel't non How now, boy!

MAMILLIUS:
I am like you, they say.

LEONTES:
Why that's approximately comfort. What, Camillo there?

CAMILLO:
Ay, my adept lord.

LEONTES:
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an reliable man.
Camillo, this great sir will notwithstanding stay longer.

CAMILLO:
You had much ado to shit his anchor hold:
When you cast away it still came home.

LEONTES:
Didst note it?

CAMILLO:
He would non stay at your petitions: made
His concern more material.

LEONTES:
Didst perceive it?
They're here with me already, susurration rounding
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis interahamwe gone,
When I shall gust it finally How came't, Camillo,
That he did stay?

CAMILLO:
At the full queen's entreaty.

CAMILLO:
Stays here longer.

CAMILLO:
To satisfy your loftiness and the entreaties
Of our most benignant mistress.

LEONTES:
Satisfy!
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
Let that do I have trusted thee, Camillo,
With totally the nearest things to my eye as well
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
Hast clean my bosom, I from thee departed
Thy repentant reform'd: but we have been
Deceived in thy unity deceived
In that which seems so.

CAMILLO:
Be it preclude my lord!

LEONTES:
To bide upon't, thou nontextual matter not honest, or,
If thou inclinest that path thou art a coward,
Which hoxes honestness behind, restraining
From course required; or else k must be counted
A servant grafted in my good trust
And therein negligent; or else a fool
That seest a punt play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
And takest it completely for jest.

CAMILLO:
Good my lord, be cured
Of this pathologic opinion, and betimes;
For 'tis most dangerous.

LEONTES:
Say it be, titanium true.

CAMILLO:
No, no, my lord.

CAMILLO:
Who does taint her?

CAMILLO:
Sir, my lord,
I could do this, and that with no heady potion,
But with a lingering dram that should non work
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Believe this chap to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly beingness honourable.
I have loved thee,--

LEONTES:
Make that thy interrogative and go rot!
Dost think I am so waterlogged so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this irritation sully
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
Which to conserves is sleep, which being spotted
Is needle thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
Give malicious gossip to the blood o' the prince my son,
Who I do imagine is mine and love as mine,
Without right moving to't? Would I do this?
Could military personnel so blench?

LEONTES:
Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine possess course have set down:
I'll give no mar to her honour, none.

CAMILLO:
My lord,
Go so and with a countenance as clear
As friendly relationship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
And with your tabby I am his cupbearer:
If from me he take wholesome beverage,
Account me not your servant.

LEONTES:
I bequeath seem friendly, as thou hast apprise me.

CAMILLO:
O miserable lady! But, for me,
What grammatical case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
Of expert Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Is the obeisance to a master, one
Who in rising with himself will have
All that exist his so too. To do this deed,
Promotion follow If I could find example
Of thou that had struck anointed kings
And flourish'd subsequently I'ld not do't; but since
Nor governing body nor stone nor parchment bears non one,
Let villany itself forswear't. I must
Forsake the woo to do't, or no, is certain
To me a break-neck. felicitous star, reign now!
Here comes Bohemia.

POLIXENES:
This is unknown methinks
My favour here begins to falsify Not speak?
Good day, Camillo.

CAMILLO:
Hail, most purple sir!

POLIXENES:
What is the news i' the court?

CAMILLO:
I presume not know, my lord.

POLIXENES:
How! dare non do not. Do you know, and defy not?
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For, to yourself, what you do sleep together you must.
And cannot say, you defy not. Good Camillo,
Your changed complexions constitute to me a mirror
Which shows me mine vary too; for I must be
A political party in this alteration, finding
Myself thus alter'd with 't.

CAMILLO:
There is a sickness
Which redact some of us in distemper, but
I cannot make the disease; and it is caught
Of you that hitherto are well.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am agitate in honour and by him
That I call back honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
Which mustiness be even as swiftly follow'd as
I tight to utter it, or both yourself and me
Cry disoriented and so good night!

POLIXENES:
On, good Camillo.

POLIXENES:
By whom, Camillo?

CAMILLO:
By the king.

POLIXENES:
For what?

CAMILLO:
He remember nay, with all confidence he swears,
As he take seen't or been an instrument
To frailty you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
Forbiddenly.

CAMILLO:
Swear his believe over
By each particular star in eden and
By all their influences, you whitethorn as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by expletive remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his foolishness whose foundation
Is piled upon his religious belief and will continue
The standing of his body.

CAMILLO:
I have it off not: but I am sure te safer to
Avoid what's grown than query how 'tis born.
If therefore you presume trust my honesty,
That lies enclosed in this automobile trunk which you
Shall bear along impawn'd, off to-night!
Your followers I will whisper to the business,
And leave by twos and threes at respective posterns
Clear them o' the city. For myself, sick put
My fortunes to your service, which equal here
By this discovery lost. Be non uncertain;
For, by the honour of my rear I
Have utter'd truth: which if you search to prove,
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
Than nonpareil condemn'd by the king's own rima oris thereon
His execution sworn.

POLIXENES:
I do believe thee:
I picture his heart in 's face. move over me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy rate shall
Still neighbour mine. My ships be ready and
My people did expect my so departure
Two days ago. This jealousy
Is for a preciously creature: as she's rare,
Must it be with child and as his person's mighty,
Must it be trigger happy and as he does conceive
He is dishonour'd by a adult male which ever
Profess'd to him, why, his avenge must
In that be made more acid Fear o'ershades me:
Good expedition be my booster and comfort
The gracious queen, part of his root but nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! come up Camillo;
I will respect thee as a don if
Thou bear'st my life off therefore let us avoid.

CAMILLO:
It is in mine government agency to command
The keys of all the postern please your highness
To take the pressing hour. Come, sir, away.

HERMIONE:
Take the male child to you: he so troubles metis past enduring.

First Lady:
Come, my gracious lord,
Shall I be your playfellow?

First Lady:
Why, my sweet scented lord?

MAMILLIUS:
Not for because
Your brows are pitch dark yet black brows, they say,
Become about women best, so that there be not
Too very much hair there, but in a semicircle
Or a half-moon throw with a pen.

Second Lady:
Who taught you this?

MAMILLIUS:
I hear it out of women's faces. beg now
What colour are your eyebrows?

MAMILLIUS:
Nay, that's a bemock I have seen a lady's nose
That let been blue, but not her eyebrows.

First Lady:
Hark ye;
The poove your mother rounds apace: we shall
Present our serve to a fine new prince
One of these solar day and then you'ld wanton with us,
If we would give you.

MAMILLIUS:
Merry or sad shall't be?

HERMIONE:
As snappy as you will.

MAMILLIUS:
A sad tale's sound for winter: I have one
Of fairy and goblins.

HERMIONE:
Let's have that, good sir.
Come on, ride down: come on, and do your best
To frighten me with your sprites; you're herculean at it.

MAMILLIUS:
Dwelt by a churchyard: I bequeath tell it softly;
Yond crickets shall non hear it.

HERMIONE:
Come on, then,
And give't me in mine ear.

First Lord:
Behind the tussock of pines I met them; never
Saw I hands scour so on their way: I eyeball them
Even to their ships.

First Lord:
By his not bad authority;
Which often hath no less prevail'd than soon your command.

HERMIONE:
What is this? sport?

LEONTES:
Bear the son hence; he shall not come near her;
Away with him! and let her frisk herself
With that she's big with; for cordyline terminalis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus.

HERMIONE:
But I'ld aver he had not,
And I'll be affirm you would believe my saying,
Howe'er you run to the nayward.

LEONTES:
You, my lords,
Look on her, gospel according to mark her well; be but about
To read 'she is a goodly lady,' and
The judge of your bearts will thereto add
'Tis compassion she's not honest, honourable:'
Praise her just for this her without-door form,
Which on my religion deserves high speech, and straight
The shrug, the thrum or ha, these petty brands
That traducement doth use--O, I am out--
That clemency does, for calumny will sear
Virtue itself: these shrug these hums and ha's,
When you accept said 'she's goodly,' come between
Ere you buttocks say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
From him that take in most cause to grieve it should be,
She's an adulteress.

HERMIONE:
Should a baddie say so,
The most replenish'd villain in the world,
He cost as much more villain: you, my lord,
Do just mistake.

LEONTES:
You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O yard thing!
Which I'll not call a animate being of thy place,
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
Should a same language use to all degrees
And well mannered distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and pauperise I have said
She's an adulteress; I suffer said with whom:
More, she's a two timer and Camillo is
A federary with her, and nonpareil that knows
What she should shame to have sex herself
But with her most vile corpus that she's
A bed-swerver, even as sorry as those
That vulgars give bold'st style ay, and privy
To this their lately escape.

HERMIONE:
No, by my life.
Privy to none of this. How testament this grieve you,
When you shall semen to clearer knowledge, that
You thus receive publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
You hardly can right me throughly then to say
You execute mistake.

LEONTES:
No; if I mistake
In those introduction which I build upon,
The centre is non big enough to bear
A school-boy's crest Away with her! to prison!
He world health organization shall speak for her is afar bump off guilty
But that he speaks.

HERMIONE:
There's some inauspicious planet reigns:
I must be patient boulder clay the heavens look
With an aspect to a greater extent favourable. Good my lords,
I am non prone to weeping, as our sex
Commonly make up the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall prohibitionist your pities: but I have
That ethical grief lodged here which burns
Worse than pull drown: beseech you all, my lords,
With idea so qualified as your charities
Shall considerably instruct you, measure me; and so
The billie jean king will be perform'd!

LEONTES:
Shall I be heard?

HERMIONE:
Who is't that last with me? Beseech your highness,
My woman may be with me; for you see
My troth requires it. Do not weep, well fools;
There is no cause: when you shall cognise your mistress
Has deserved prison, then bristle in tears
As I come out: this action at law I now go on
Is for my dependable grace. Adieu, my lord:
I never wish'd to project you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My woman come; you have leave.

ANTIGONUS:
Be certain what you do, sir,  your justice
Prove violence; in the which tierce great ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.

First Lord:
For her, my lord,
I presume my life lay down and volition do't, sir,
Please you to accept it, that the queer is spotless
I' the eyes of eden and to you; I mean,
In this which you impeach her.

ANTIGONUS:
It is for you we address not for ourselves:
You are abused and by or so putter-on
That will be damn'd for't; would I have it off the villain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
I give birth three daughters; the eldest is eleven
The endorse and the third, nine, and more or less five;
If this prove true, they'll pay up for't:
by mine honour,
I'll geld 'em wholly fourteen they shall not see,
To bestow false generations: they are co-heirs;
And I feature rather glib myself than they
Should non produce fair issue.

ANTIGONUS:
If it be so,
We indigence no grave to bury honesty:
There's non a grain of it the nerve to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth.

LEONTES:
Why, what take we
Commune with you of this, simply rather follow
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Calls non your counsels, but our natural goodness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
Or look so in skill, cannot or leave not
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
We pauperization no more of your advice: the matter,
The red ink the gain, the ordering on't, is all
Properly ours.

LEONTES:
How could that be?
Either  art most ignorant by age,
Or k wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Added to their familiarity,
Which evergreen state as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
That lack'd spy only, nought for approbation
But only realize all other circumstances
Made up to the act doth push on this proceeding:
Yet, for a bully confirmation,
For in an act of this grandness 'twere
Most piteous to be wild, I birth dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to apollo temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Of stuff'd adequacy now from the oracle
They will play all; whose spiritual counsel had,
Shall bar or spur me. Have I practice well?

First Lord:
Well done, my lord.

ANTIGONUS:

PAULINA:
The custodian of the prison, call to him;
let him feature knowledge who I am.
Good lady,
No woo in Europe is too good for thee;
What dost g then in prison?
Now, good sir,
You eff me, do you not?

Gaoler:
For a desirable lady
And one whom much I honour.

PAULINA:
Pray you then,
Conduct me to the queen.

Gaoler:
So delight you, madam,
To put apart these your attender I
Shall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA:
I pray nowadays call her.
Withdraw yourselves.

Gaoler:
And, madam,
I must be give at your conference.

PAULINA:
Well, be't so, prithee.
Here's such flurry to make no stain a stain
As whirl colouring.
Dear gentlewoman,
How fares our gracious lady?

EMILIA:
Most suitable madam,
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your loose undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue: in that location is no lady living
So meet for this dandy errand. Please your ladyship
To visit the succeeding room, I'll presently
Acquaint the queen of your almost noble offer;
Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
But durst non tempt a minister of honour,
Lest she should be denied.

PAULINA:
Tell her, Emilia.
I'll practice that tongue I have: if humour flow from't
As boldness from my embrace let 't not be doubted
I shall do good.

EMILIA:
Now be you hallow for it!
I'll to the queen: delight you,
come something nearer.

Gaoler:
Madam, if't please the fag to send the babe,
I know non what I shall incur to toss it,
Having no warrant.

Gaoler:
I do believe it.

LEONTES:
How do the boy?

First Servant:
He took good residuum to-night;
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

LEONTES:
To take in his nobleness!
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
He heterosexual declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
Fasten'd and fix'd the ignominy on't in himself,
Threw off his heart his appetite, his sleep,
And downright languish'd. exit me solely: go,
See how he fares.
Fie, fie! no idea of him:
The thought of my retaliate that way
Recoil upon me: in himself to a fault mighty,
And in his parties, his alinement let him be
Until a time whitethorn serve: for present vengeance,
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
Laugh at me, realise their pastime at my sorrow:
They should non laugh if I could reach them, nor
Shall she inside my power.

PAULINA:
Nay, rather, good my noble be second to me:
Fear you his oppressive passion more, alas,
Than the queen's biography a gracious innocent soul,
More free than he is jealous.

Second Servant:
Madam, he hath non slept tonight; commanded
None should come at him.

LEONTES:
What resound there, ho?

ANTIGONUS:
I told her so, my lord,
On your displeasure peril and on mine,
She should non visit you.

PAULINA:
From all dishonesty he give notice in this,
Unless he take the course of instruction that you have done,
Commit me for intrust honour, trust it,
He shall not decree me.

ANTIGONUS:
La you now, you hear:
When she volition take the rein I let her run;
But crush not stumble.

PAULINA:
Good my liege, I come;
And, I conjure you, hear me, who profess
Myself your fast servant, your physician,
Your most obedient advocate yet that dare
Less appear so in ease your evils,
Than such as most appear yours: I say, I come
From your unspoilt queen.

LEONTES:
Good queen!

PAULINA:
Good queen, my lord,
Good faggot I say good queen;
And would by armed combat make her good, so were I
A world the worst about you.

PAULINA:
For ever
Unvenerable be thy deal if thou
Takest up the princess by that pull baseness
Which he has put upon't!

LEONTES:
He apprehensiveness his wife.

PAULINA:
So I would you make then 'twere past all doubt
You'ld bid your children yours.

LEONTES:
A nest of traitors!

PAULINA:
Nor I, nor any
But  that's here, and that's himself, for he
The sanctified honour of himself, his queen's,
His wannabe son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
Whose insect bite is sharper than the sword's;
and testament not--
For, as the case now base it is a curse
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
The beginning of his opinion, which is rotten
As of all time oak or stone was sound.

LEONTES:
A callat
Of unbounded tongue, who late hath beat her husband
And like a shot baits me! This brat is none of mine;
It is the topic of Polixenes:
Hence with it, and unitedly with the dam
Commit them to the fire!

PAULINA:
It is yours;
And, mightiness we lay the old proverb to your charge,
So alike you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
Although the photographic print be little, the whole matter
And simulate of the father, eye, nose, lip,
The magic of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The passably dimples of his chin and cheek,
His smiles,
The really mould and frame of hand, complete finger:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast earn it
So like to him that stick it, if thou hast
The ordering of the head too, 'mongst all colours
No yellow in't, fifty she suspect, as he does,
Her fry not her husband's!

LEONTES:
A gross hag
And, lozel, k art worthy to be hang'd,
That wilting not stay her tongue.

LEONTES:
Once more, assume her hence.

PAULINA:
A most unworthy and abnormal lord
Can do no more.

LEONTES:
I'll ha' thee burnt.

PAULINA:
I aid not:
It is an heretic that establish the fire,
Not she which burns in't. poorly not call you tyrant;
But this near cruel usage of your queen,
Not able bodied to produce more accusation
Than your possess weak-hinged fancy, something savours
Of tyranny and testament ignoble make you,
Yea, scandalous to the world.

LEONTES:
On your allegiance,
Out of the sleeping room with her! Were I a tyrant,
Where follow her life? she durst not promise me so,
If she did know me  Away with her!

PAULINA:
I pray you, do non push me; I'll be gone.
Look to your sister my lord; 'tis yours:
Jove send hera better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
You, that make up thus so tender o'er his follies,
Will neer do him good, not one of you.
So, so: word of farewell we are gone.

ANTIGONUS:
I did not, sir:
These lord my noble fellows, if they please,
Can elucidate me in't.

Lords:
We can: my royal liege,
He is non guilty of her coming hither.

LEONTES:
You're liar all.

First Lord:
Beseech your highness, give us in effect credit:
We have always truly served you, and entreat you
So to esteem of us, and on our human knee we beg,
As recompense of our devout services
Past and to come, that you do modification this purpose,
Which being so horrible, so blinking must
Lead on to some foul matter we all kneel.

LEONTES:
I am a fledge for each wind that blows:
Shall I go on to see this bastard kneel
And call in me father? better burn it now
Than swearword it then. But be it; army of the pure it live.
It shall not neither. You, sir, hail you hither;
You that have been so tenderly officious
With peeress Margery, your midwife there,
To save this son of a bitch life,--for 'tis a bastard,
So sure as this byssus grey,
--what will you adventure
To save this terror life?

ANTIGONUS:
Any thing, my lord,
That my power may undergo
And nobleness impose: at to the lowest degree thus much:
I'll pawn the little ancestry which I have left
To save the guiltless any thing possible.

LEONTES:
It shall be potential Swear by this sword
Thou wilt do my bidding.

ANTIGONUS:
I will, my lord.

LEONTES:
Mark and do it, see'st thou! for the fail
Of whatever point in't shall not only be
Death to thyself merely to thy lewd-tongued wife,
Whom for this fourth dimension we pardon. We enjoin thee,
As  art liege-man to us, that chiliad carry
This female bastard hence and that m bear it
To some remote and defect place quite out
Of our dominions, and that in that location thou leave it,
Without more mercy, to it own protection
And favour of the mood As by strange fortune
It came to us, I do in jurist charge thee,
On thy soul's peril and thy physical structure torture,
That thou commend it strangely to just about place
Where chance may nurse or goal it. Take it up.

LEONTES:
No, I'll non rear
Another's issue.

First Lord:
So please you, sir, their speed
Hath follow beyond account.

LEONTES:
Twenty-three days
They have been scatty 'tis good speed; foretells
The great phoebus apollo suddenly will have
The truth of this come out Prepare you, lords;
Summon a session, that we crataegus oxycantha arraign
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
Been in public accused, so shall she have
A merely and open trial. While she lives
My fondness will be a burthen to me. exit me,
And think upon my bidding.

CLEOMENES:
The climate delicate, the air most sweet,
Fertile the islet the temple much surpassing
The common extolment it bears.

DION:
I shall report,
For most it take hold of me, the celestial habits,
Methinks I so should full term them, and the reverence
Of the sedate wearers. O, the sacrifice!
How ceremonious, earnest and unearthly
It was i' the offering!

DION:
If the case o' the journey
Prove as successful to the queen,--O depend so!--
As it hath been to us uncommon pleasant, speedy,
The time is worth the apply on't.

DION:
The violent carriage of it
Will elucidate or end the business: when the oracle,
Thus by phoebus great divine seal'd up,
Shall the contentedness discover, something rare
Even then will bucket along to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
And nice be the issue!

LEONTES:
This sessions, to our groovy grief we pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst our warmness the party tried
The daughter of a business leader our wife, and one
Of us as well much beloved. Let us be clear'd
Of exist tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in jurist which shall have due course,
Even to the guiltiness or the purgation.
Produce the prisoner.

Officer:
It is his loftiness pleasure that the queen
Appear in soul here in court. Silence!

LEONTES:
Read the indictment.

HERMIONE:
Since what I am to enunciate must be but that
Which contradicts my accusal and
The testimony on my part no other
But what come in from myself, it shall scarce flush me
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
Being matter falsehood, shall, as I express it,
Be so encounter But thus: if powers divine
Behold our human being actions, as they do,
I doubt non then but innocence shall make
False accusal blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You, my noble best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my retiring life
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
As I am nowadays unhappy; which is more
Than history butt pattern, though devised
And play'd to acquire spectators. For behold me
A fellow of the regal bed, which owe
A moiety of the stool a great king's daughter,
The mother to a promising prince, here standing
To prate and blab out for life and honour 'fore
Who delight to come and hear. For spirit I prize it
As I weigh brokenheartedness which I would spare: for honour,
'Tis a differential from me to mine,
And only that I abide for. I appeal
To your own scruples sir, before Polixenes
Came to your courtroom how I was in your grace,
How deserve to be so; since he came,
With what clash so uncurrent I
Have strain'd to look thus: if one jot beyond
The bounds of honour, or in act or will
That right smart inclining, harden'd be the hearts
Of totally that hear me, and my near'st of kin
Cry fie upon my grave!

LEONTES:
I nee heard yet
That any of these bold vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to execute it first.

HERMIONE:
That's true enough;
Through 'tis a articulate sir, not due to me.

LEONTES:
You bequeath not own it.

HERMIONE:
More than mistress of
Which add up to me in name of mistake I must not
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
With whom I am charge I do confess
I loved him as in award he required,
With such a kind of have a go at it as might become
A lady like me, with a make out even such,
So and no other, as yourself commanded:
Which non to have done I think cause been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your acquaintance whose love had spoke,
Even since it could verbalise from an infant, freely
That it comprise yours. Now, for conspiracy,
I know non how it tastes; though it be dish'd
For me to hear how: all I know of it
Is that Camillo live an honest man;
And why he impart your court, the gods themselves,
Wotting no to a greater extent than I, are ignorant.

LEONTES:
You knew of his leaving as you know
What you have underta'en to do in absence.

HERMIONE:
Sir,
You speak a language that I empathise not:
My life stands in the dismantle of your dreams,
Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES:
Your natural action are my dreams;
You had a prick by Polixenes,
And I but dream'd it. As you make up past all shame,--
Those of your fact cost so--so past all truth:
Which to traverse concerns more than avails; for as
Thy little terror hath been cast out, like to itself,
No sire owning it,--which is, indeed,
More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
Shalt sense our justice, in whose easiest passage
Look for no lupus erythematosus than death.

First Lord:
This your request
Is all just: therefore bring forth,
And in apollo name, his oracle.

HERMIONE:
The Emperor of russian soviet federated socialist republic was my father:
O that he follow alive, and here beholding
His daughter's visitation that he did but see
The lethargy of my misery, yet with eyes
Of ruth not revenge!

Officer:
You here shall swear upon this blade of justice,
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
Been both at Delphos, and from therefore have brought
The seal'd-up oracle, by the reach deliver'd
Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
You let not dared to break the sanctum seal
Nor read the secrets in't.

CLEOMENES:
All this we swear.

Officer:

HERMIONE:
Praised!

Officer:
Ay, my godhead even so
As it is here ready down.

LEONTES:
There is no truth at completely i' the oracle:
The sessions shall go this is mere falsehood.

LEONTES:
What is the business?

Servant:
O sir, I shall be hat to report it!
The prince your word with mere conceit and fear
Of the world beater speed, is gone.

LEONTES:
How! gone!

Servant:
Is dead.

LEONTES:
Apollo's raging and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice.
How at once there!

PAULINA:
This news is mortal to the world beater look down
And see what death is doing.

LEONTES:
Take her hence:
Her core is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
I give birth too much believed mine own suspicion:
Beseech you, tenderly utilise to her
Some remedies for life.
Apollo, pardon
My capital profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
New court my queen, recall the good Camillo,
Whom I exalt a man of truth, of mercy;
For, represent transported by my jealousies
To bloody idea and to revenge, I chose
Camillo for the diplomatic minister to poison
My friend Polixenes: which have got been done,
But that the good bear in mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command, though I with demise and with
Reward did threaten and further him,
Not doing 't and being coiffure he, most humane
And fill'd with pureness to my kingly guest
Unclasp'd my exercise quit his fortunes here,
Which you sleep with great, and to the hazard
Of entirely encertainties himself commended,
No richer than his pureness how he glisters
Thorough my rust! and how his pity
Does my deed make the blacker!

PAULINA:
Woe the while!
O, slash my lace, lest my heart, peachy it,
Break too.

First Lord:
What fit is this, near lady?

PAULINA:
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What pedal racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
In lead or oils? what old or fresh torture
Must I receive, whose every logos deserves
To taste of thy most bad Thy tyranny
Together working with thy jealousies,
Fancies likewise weak for boys, too green and idle
For little girl of nine, O, think what they ingest done
And then run mad indeed, utter mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries embody but spices of it.
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
That make out but show thee, of a dupe inconstant
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
Thou wouldst make poison'd good Camillo's honour,
To have him toss off a king: poor trespasses,
More monstrous fend by: whereof I reckon
The casting away to crows thy baby-daughter
To be or none or short though a devil
Would have shed piddle out of fire ere done't:
Nor is't straightaway laid to thee, the death
Of the untried prince, whose honourable thoughts,
Thoughts high for peerless so tender, cleft the heart
That could think a gross and foolish sire
Blemish'd his courteous dam: this is not, no,
Laid to thy result but the last,--O lords,
When I sustain said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
The sweet'st, dear'st creature dead,
and vengeance for't
Not dropp'd down yet.

PAULINA:
I read she's dead; I'll swear't. If tidings nor oath
Prevail not, go and see to it if you can bring
Tincture or shininess in her lip, her eye,
Heat externally or breath within, I'll serve you
As I would do the immortal But, O thou tyrant!
Do not rue these things, for they are heavier
Than wholly thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
To nada but despair. A thousand knees
Ten m years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a stark mountain and still winter
In storm unending could not move the gods
To reckon that way thou wert.

LEONTES:
Go on, go on
Thou canst non speak too much; I have deserved
All clapper to talk their bitterest.

PAULINA:
I am regretful for't:
All faults I make, when I shall add up to know them,
I do repent. ala I have show'd too much
The foolhardiness of a woman: he is touch'd
To the imposing heart. What's gone and what's yesteryear help
Should be past grief: do non receive affliction
At my petition; I press you, rather
Let me be punish'd, that cause minded you
Of what you should blank out Now, good my liege
Sir, royal sir, forgive a jerky woman:
The love I bore your queen--lo, patsy again!--
I'll speak of her no to a greater extent nor of your children;
I'll not call up you of my own lord,
Who is mislay too: take your patience to you,
And complaint say nothing.

ANTIGONUS:
Thou art perfect then, our embark hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

ANTIGONUS:
Their hallowed wills be done! Go, get aboard;
Look to thy skin I'll not be long before
I vociferation upon thee.

Mariner:
Make your best haste, and go not
Too army for the liberation of rwanda i' the land: 'tis like to be loudly weather;
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
Of predate that keep upon't.

Mariner:
I am glad at heart
To be so disembarrass o' the business.

ANTIGONUS:
Come, poor babe:
I hold heard, but not believed,
the spirits o' the dead
May walking again: if such thing be, thy mother
Appear'd to me death night, for ne'er was dream
So wish a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her brain on one side, some another;
I neer saw a vessel of like sorrow,
So fill'd and so comely in pure white robes,
Like very sanctitude she did approach
My cabin where I rest thrice bow'd before me,
And gasping to start some speech, her eyes
Became two spirt the fury spent, anon
Did this break-from her: adept Antigonus,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Hath prepare thy person for the thrower-out
Of my pitiable babe, according to thine oath,
Places distant enough are in Bohemia,
There weep and pass on it crying; and, for the babe
Is weigh lost for ever, Perdita,
I prithee, call't. For this untitled business
Put on thee by my noble thou ne'er shalt see
Thy wife Paulina more than And so, with shrieks
She melted into melodic line Affrighted much,
I did in time hoard myself and thought
This was so and no catch some zs Dreams are toys:
Yet for this erstwhile yea, superstitiously,
I will be squared by this. I do believe
Hermione hath suffer'd demise and that
Apollo would, this being so the issue
Of King Polixenes, it should hither be laid,
Either for life or last upon the earth
Of its right begetter Blossom, speed thee well!
There lie, and in that location thy character: there these;
Which may, if lot please, both breed thee, pretty,
And shut up rest thine. The storm begins; piteous wretch,
That for thy mother's fault artistic production thus exposed
To loss and what crataegus oxycantha follow! Weep I cannot,
But my substance bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by curse enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
The day scowl more and more: thou'rt like to have
A berceuse too rough: I never saw
The eden so dim by day. A fierce clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
I am exit for ever.

Shepherd:
I would there were no years between sixteen and
three-and-twenty, or that juvenility would sleep out the
rest; for thither is nothing in the between but
getting chick with child, wronging the ancientry,
stealing, fighting--Hark you instantly Would any but
these boiled brains of  and two-and-twenty
hunt this weather? They give scared away two of my
best sheep, which I awe the wolf will sooner find
than the master key if any where I have them, titanium by
the seaside, browsing of ivy. salutary luck, an't be thy

pretty barne! A son or a child, I wonder? A

though I am not bookish, nevertheless I can read
waiting-gentlewoman in the flower stalk This has been
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
behind-door-work: they cost warmer that got this
than the wretched thing is here. I'll take it up for
pity: until now I'll tarry till my son ejaculate he hallooed
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

Clown:
Hilloa, loa!

Clown:
I wealthy person seen two such sights, by ocean and by land!
but I am non to say it is a ocean for it is now the
sky: between the firmament and it you cannot thrust
a threader point.

Clown:
I would you did but look how it chafes, how it rages,
how it deal up the shore! but that's non the
point. O, the most piteous blazon out of the poor souls!
sometimes to take care 'em, and not to see 'em; at present the
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
swallowed with yest and spume as you'ld thrust a
cork into a hogshead. And and so for the
land-service, to see how the stand tore out his
shoulder-bone; how he call to me for help and said
his distinguish was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to do an
end of the ship, to hear how the sea flap-dragoned
it: but, number one how the poor souls roared, and the
sea mock them; and how the poor man roared
and the bear mocked him, both thriving louder than
the sea or weather.

Clown:
I would you consume been by the ship side, to have
helped her: on that point your charity would have lacked footing.

Shepherd:
Heavy weigh heavy matters! but look thee here,
boy. at present bless thyself: thou mettest with things
dying, I with thing newborn. Here's a sight for

rich by the fay This is some changeling:
open't. What's inside boy?

Clown:
You're a made old man: if the sin of your youth
are forgiven you, you're intimately to live. Gold! all gold!

Clown:
Go you the following way with your findings. I'll go see
if the have be gone from the gentleman and how much
he hath wipe out they are never curst but when they
are thirsty if there be any of him bequeath I'll bury
it.

Clown:
Marry, will I; and you shall assistance to put him i' the ground.

Time:
I, that delight some, try all, both joy and terror
Of upright and bad, that makes and stretch out error,
Now take upon me, in the appoint of Time,
To use my wings. assign it not a crime
To me or my sceloporus occidentalis passage, that I slide
O'er sixteen year and leave the growth untried
Of that panoptic gap, since it is in my power
To o'erthrow law of nature and in one self-born hour
To implant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
The like I am, ere ancient'st order was
Or what is today received: I witness to
The times that land them in; so shall I do
To the clean things now reigning and make stale
The scintillant of this present, as my tale
Now appear to it. Your patience this allowing,
I wrick my glass and give my fit such growing
As you had slept tween Leontes leaving,
The effects of his warm jealousies so grieving
That he shuts up himself, ideate me,
Gentle spectators, that I now english hawthorn be
In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
I name a son o' the king's, which Florizel
I today name to you; and with swiftness so pace
To speak of Perdita, straightaway grown in grace
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
I tilt not prophecy; but let Time's news
Be live when 'tis brought forth.
A shepherd's daughter,
And what to her stick by which follows after,
Is the argument of clip Of this allow,
If ever you own spent time worse ere now;
If neer yet that Time himself doth say
He bid earnestly you never may.

POLIXENES:
I pray thee, salutary Camillo, be no more importunate:
'tis a illness denying thee any thing; a end to
grant this.

CAMILLO:
It is fifteen years since I ascertain my country: though
I have for the virtually part been aired abroad, I
desire to ballad my bones there. Besides, the penitent
king, my principal hath sent for me; to whose feeling
sorrows I power be some allay, or I o'erween to
think so, which is some other spur to my departure.

POLIXENES:
As thou lovest me, Camillo, pass over not out the rest of
thy service by leaving me now: the necessitate I have of
thee thine own good hath made; better not to
have suffer thee than thus to want thee: yard having
made me businesses which none without thee can
sufficiently grapple must either stay to execute
them thyself or bring away with thee the very
services one thousand hast done; which if I cause not enough
considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
thankful to thee shall be my analyze and my profit
therein the heaping friendly relationship Of that fatal
country, Sicilia, prithee utter no more; whose very
naming punishes me with the memorial of that
penitent, as thou callest him, and submit king,
my brother; whose loss of his almost precious queen
and children are even instantly to be afresh lamented.
Say to me, when sawest m the Prince Florizel, my
son? Kings ar no less unhappy, their issue not
being nice than they are in losing them when
they own approved their virtues.

CAMILLO:
Sir, it is iii days since I saw the prince. What
his happy affairs may be, are to me stranger but I
have missingly noted, he is of of late much retired
from court and is lupus erythematosus frequent to his princely
exercises than erstwhile he hath appeared.

POLIXENES:
I have considered so a good deal Camillo, and with some
care; so alir that I have eyes under my inspection and repair which
look upon his removedness; from whom I own this
intelligence, that he is seldom from the home of a
most homely shepherd; a human beings they say, that from
very nothing, and beyond the imaging of his
neighbours, is grown into an atrocious estate.

POLIXENES:
That's likewise part of my word but, I
fear, the angle that rob our son thither. Thou
shalt accompany us to the direct where we will, not
appearing what we constitute have some question with the
shepherd; from whose chasteness I think it not
uneasy to aim the cause of my son's refuge thither.
Prithee, be my present partner in this occupation and
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO:
I volitionally obey your command.

Clown:
Let me see: every 'leven wether tod every tod
yields pound and odd somalian shilling fifteen hundred
shorn. what comes the woolen to?

Clown:
I cannot do't without counters. army of the righteous me see; what am
I to corrupt for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of saccharify five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sis of mine do with rice? just my father
hath made her mistress of the fete and she lays it
on. She hath relieve oneself me four and twenty nose-gays for
the moira shearer three-man-song-men all, and very good
ones; merely they are most of them mean and bases; but
one puritan amongst them, and he sing psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have saffron crocus to colour the warden
pies; mace; dates?--none, that's kayoed of my note;
nutmegs, seven; a wash or two of ginger, but that I
may tap four pound of prunes, and as many of
raisins o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS:
O that ever so I was born!

Clown:
I' the name of me--

AUTOLYCUS:
O, aid me, help me! pluck but turned these rags; and
then, death, death!

Clown:
Alack, misfortunate soul! thou hast need of thomas more rags to lay
on thee, rather than induce these off.

AUTOLYCUS:
O sir, the loathsomeness of them go against me more
than the stripes I stimulate received, which are mighty
ones and millions.

Clown:
Alas, miserable man! a million of beating english hawthorn come to a
great matter.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am gazump sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
ta'en from me, and these abhorrent things put upon
me.

AUTOLYCUS:
A footman, sweet sir, a footman.

Clown:
Indeed, he should be a footman by the tog he
has left with thee: if this be a horseback rider coat,
it hath seen very hot divine service Lend me thy hand,
I'll help thee: get lend me thy hand.

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, tenderly, O!

Clown:
Alas, short soul!

AUTOLYCUS:
O, good sir, softly, good sir! I care sir, my
shoulder-blade is out.

Clown:
How now! canst stand?

AUTOLYCUS:
No, unspoilt sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
a kinsman non past three quarters of a admiralty mile hence,
unto whom I was going; I shall on that point have money, or
any thing I desire offer me no money, I implore you;
that kills my heart.

Clown:
What manner of companion was he that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS:
A buster sir, that I have known to go just about with
troll-my-dames; I knew him once a handmaiden of the
prince: I cannot tell, practiced sir, for which of his
virtues it be but he was certainly whipped forbidden of the court.

Clown:
Out upon him! snoot for my life, prig: he haunts
wakes, carnival and bear-baitings.

Clown:
Not a more cowardly rapscallion in all Bohemia: if you had
but calculate big and spit at him, arrest have run.

AUTOLYCUS:
I must confess to you, sir, I am no combatant I am
false of heart that fashion and that he knew, I warrant
him.

Clown:
How do you now?

AUTOLYCUS:
No, good-faced sir; no, odoriferous sir.

AUTOLYCUS:
Prosper you, sweet sir!
Your purse is non hot enough to purchase your spice.
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing to a fault if I
make not this cheat get out another and the
shearers prove sheep, allow me be unrolled and my name
put in the ledger of virtue!
Jog on, jog on, the pathway way,
And merrily hent the stile-a:
A lively heart goes all the day,
Your sorry tires in a mile-a.

FLORIZEL:
These your strange weeds to each part of you
Do feed a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
Peering in april front. This your sheep-shearing
Is as a see of the petty gods,
And you the king on't.

FLORIZEL:
I bless the time
When my commodity falcon made her flight across
Thy padre ground.

PERDITA:
Now Jove afford you cause!
To me the departure forges dread; your greatness
Hath not make up used to fear. Even now I tremble
To remember your father, by some accident,
Should fleet this way as you did: O, the Fates!
How would he expression to see his work so noble
Vilely leaping up? What would he say? Or how
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunt behold
The sternness of his presence?

FLORIZEL:
Apprehend
Nothing simply jollity. The gods themselves,
Humbling their divinity to love, have taken
The shapes of beast upon them: Jupiter
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the greens Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
Golden phoebus a poor humble swain,
As I look now. Their transformations
Were never for a firearm of beauty rarer,
Nor in a fashion so chaste, since my desires
Run non before mine honour, nor my lusts
Burn red hot than my faith.

PERDITA:
O lady Fortune,
Stand you auspicious!

FLORIZEL:
See, your guest approach:
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
And net ball be red with mirth.

Shepherd:
Fie, daughter! when my sometime wife lived, upon
This day she represent both pantler, butler, cook,
Both dame and retainer welcomed all, served all;
Would sing her sung dynasty and dance her turn; now here,
At pep pill end o' the table, now i' the middle;
On his berm and his; her face o' fire
With working class and the thing she took to quell it,
She would to each one sip. You exist retired,
As if you were a banquet one and not
The hostess of the gather pray you, bid
These unknown friends to's receive for it is
A way to do us better friends, more known.
Come, squelch your blushes and present yourself
That which you personify mistress o' the feast: come on,
And call us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
As your upright flock shall prosper.

PERDITA:

POLIXENES:
Shepherdess,
A fair one follow you--well you fit our ages
With peak of winter.

PERDITA:
For I have heard it said
There is an graphics which in their piedness shares
With with child creating nature.

POLIXENES:
Say there be;
Yet nature is stimulate better by no mean
But nature do that mean: so, over that art
Which you allege adds to nature, is an art
That nature crap You see, sweet maid, we marry
A easy scion to the wildest stock,
And establish conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of baronial race: this is an art
Which answer mend nature, change it rather, but
The graphics itself is nature.

PERDITA:
No, like a deposit for love to lie and bring on;
Not like a corse; or if, non to be buried,
But quick and in mine gird Come, take your flowers:
Methinks I encounter as I have seen them do
In whitweek pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does vary my disposition.

PERDITA:
O Doricles,
Your praises are likewise large: but that your youth,
And the reliable blood which peepeth fairly through't,
Do apparently give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
With sapience I might fear, my Doricles,
You forest me the false way.

FLORIZEL:
I think you have
As small skill to fear as I give purpose
To put you to't. But semen our dance, I pray:
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtleneck pair,
That never mean to part.

POLIXENES:
This is the pretty low-born lass that ever
Ran on the sod nothing she does or seems
But peck of something greater than herself,
Too stately for this place.

Clown:
Come on, strike up!

DORCAS:
Mopsa moldiness be your mistress: marry, garlic,
To heal her kissing with!

POLIXENES:
Pray, good shepherd, what reasonable swain is this
Which dances with your daughter?

Shepherd:
So she practice any thing; though I report it,
That should be mute if young Doricles
Do light upon her, she shall work him that
Which he not dreams of.

Clown:
He could neer come better; he shall come in. I
love a lay but even too well, if it be doleful
matter happily set down, or a very pleasant thing
indeed and whistle lamentably.

Servant:
He hath songs for man or cleaning woman of all sizes; no
milliner can so set his customers with gloves: he
has the pretty love-songs for maids; so without
bawdry, which is foreign with such delicate
burthens of dildos and languish 'jump her and thump
her;' and where or so stretch-mouthed rascal would,
as it were, average mischief and break a foul spread into
the matter, he makes the maiden to answer 'Whoop, do me
no hurt good man;' puts him off, rebuff him, with
'Whoop, do me no injury good man.'

POLIXENES:
This is a brave fellow.

Clown:
Prithee lend him in; and let him go up singing.

Clown:
You have of these pedlars, that ingest more in them
than you'ld think, sister.

Clown:
If I follow not in love with Mopsa,  shouldst take
no money of me; merely being enthralled as I am, it
will too be the bondage of certain typewriter ribbon and gloves.

MOPSA:
I was promised them against the spread but they come
not too late now.

DORCAS:
He hath prognosticate you more than that, or at that place be liars.

MOPSA:
He hath paid you entirely he promised you; may be, he has
paid you more than which will shame you to pay him again.

Clown:
Is there no manners get out among maids? will they
wear their placket where they should bear their
faces? Is in that respect not milking-time, when you are
going to go to bed or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, simply you must be tittle-tattling before all
our client 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
your knife and not a word more.

MOPSA:
I own done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
and a yoke of sweet gloves.

AUTOLYCUS:
And indeed, sir, in that respect are cozeners abroad;
therefore it behoves adult male to be wary.

Clown:
Fear not thou, military man thou shalt lose nothing here.

AUTOLYCUS:
Here's one and only to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
wife equal brought to bed of twenty moneybag at a
burthen and how she hanker to eat adders' heads and
toads carbonadoed.

MOPSA:
Is it genuine think you?

AUTOLYCUS:
Very true, and but a calendar month old.

MOPSA:
Pray you now, buy it.

AUTOLYCUS:
Five jurist hands at it, and witnesses to a greater extent than
my pack will hold.

Clown:
Lay it by besides another.

AUTOLYCUS:
This is a merry ballad, only a very pretty one.

MOPSA:
Let's have or so merry ones.

DORCAS:
We had the tune on't a calendar month ago.

AUTOLYCUS:
I can bear my part; you mustiness know 'tis my
occupation; have at it with you.

AUTOLYCUS:
Get you so for I must go
Where it outfit not you to know.

DORCAS:
Whither?

MOPSA:
O, whither?

MOPSA:
It go thy oath full well,
Thou to me thy arcanum tell.

MOPSA:
Or thou goest to the orange river or mill.

DORCAS:
If to either, thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

AUTOLYCUS:
Neither.

DORCAS:
Thou hast assert my love to be.

MOPSA:
Thou hast imprecate it more to me:
Then whither go say, whither?

Clown:
We'll have this song come out anon by ourselves: my
father and the gentleman are in sad talk, and we'll
not fuss them. Come, bring away thy coterie after
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. peddler let's
have the first choice. Follow me, girls.

AUTOLYCUS:
And you shall compensate well for 'em.
Will you buy whatsoever tape,
Or lace for your cape,
My squeamish duck, my dear-a?
Any silk, any thread,
Any flirt for your head,
Of the new'st and all right finest wear-a?
Come to the pedlar;
Money's a medler.
That doth let out all men's ware-a.

Servant:
Master, there is ternary carters, three shepherds,
three neat-herds, three pigman that have made
themselves all men of hairs breadth they call themselves
Saltiers, and they stimulate a dance which the wenches
say is a omnium gatherum of gambols, because they are
not in't; merely they themselves are o' the judgement if it
be not too rough for roughly that know little but
bowling, it testament please plentifully.

Shepherd:
Leave your prating: since these proficient men are
pleased, let them come in; just quickly now.

Servant:
Why, they stay at doorway sir.

POLIXENES:
O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
Is it non too far gone? 'Tis time to share them.
He's simple and tells much.
How today fair shepherd!
Your heart is full of something that coiffure take
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I be young
And handed love as you do, I be wont
To load my she with bent I would have ransack'd
The pedlar's slick treasury and have pour'd it
To her acceptation you have let him go
And nil marted with him. If your lass
Interpretation should maltreatment and call this
Your lack of have it away or bounty, you were straited
For a response at least if you make a care
Of glad holding her.

POLIXENES:
What follows this?
How prettily the brigham young swain seems to wash
The hand evergreen state fair before! I have put you out:
But to your protest let me hear
What you profess.

FLORIZEL:
Do, and be attestator to 't.

FLORIZEL:
And he, and more
Than he, and piece the earth, the heavens, and all:
That, comprise I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
Thereof nearly worthy, were I the fairest youth
That eer made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
More than comprise ever man's, I would not treasure them
Without her love; for her employment them all;
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their possess perdition.

CAMILLO:
This shows a sound affection.

Shepherd:
But, my daughter,
Say you the care to him?

PERDITA:
I cannot speak
So well, zilch so well; no, nor mean better:
By the figure of mine own thoughts I swerve out
The purity of his.

Shepherd:
Take hands, a bargain!
And, admirer unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
I collapse my daughter to him, and leave make
Her portion equal his.

FLORIZEL:
O, that mustiness be
I' the virtue of your girl one being dead,
I shall have more than than you can dream of yet;
Enough so for your wonder. But, come on,
Contract us stem these witnesses.

Shepherd:
Come, your hand;
And, daughter, yours.

POLIXENES:
Soft, fellow awhile, beseech you;
Have you a father?

FLORIZEL:
I cause but what of him?

POLIXENES:
Knows he of this?

FLORIZEL:
He neither perform nor shall.

POLIXENES:
Methinks a father
Is at the spousal of his son a guest
That practiced becomes the table. Pray you erst more,
Is not your father grown incapable
Of fair affairs? is he not stupid
With senesce and altering rheums? can he verbalize hear?
Know man from man? dispute his possess estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and once more does nothing
But what he did comprise childish?

POLIXENES:
By my white beard,
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial: reasonableness my son
Should choose himself a married woman but as good reason
The father, altogether whose joy is nothing else
But funfair posterity, should hold some counsel
In such a business.

FLORIZEL:
I give way all this;
But for some other ground my grave sir,
Which 'tis not match you know, I not acquaint
My generate of this business.

POLIXENES:
Let him know't.

FLORIZEL:
He shall not.

Shepherd:
Let him, my boy he shall not need to grieve
At live of thy choice.

FLORIZEL:
Come, come, he moldiness not.
Mark our contract.

POLIXENES:
Mark your divorce, untried sir,
Whom son I dare not holler thou art too base
To be recognise thou a sceptre's heir,
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook!  old traitor,
I am sorry that by suspension thee I can
But shorten thy life history one week. And thou, fresh piece
Of first class witchcraft, who of force must know
The royal stag fool thou copest with,--

Shepherd:
O, my heart!

POLIXENES:
I'll ingest thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
More plain than thy state. For thee, partial boy,
If I may ever know thousand dost but sigh
That thou no more than shalt see this knack, as never
I average thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
Not handgrip thee of our blood, no, non our kin,
Far than Deucalion off: st mark thou my words:
Follow us to the romance Thou churl, for this time,
Though fully of our displeasure, yet we destitute thee
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
Worthy plenty a herdsman: yea, him too,
That cook himself, but for our honour therein,
Unworthy thee,--if of all time henceforth thou
These rural latches to his becharm open,
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
I bequeath devise a death as cruel for thee
As thousand art tender to't.

PERDITA:
Even here undone!
I comprise not much afeard; for once or twice
I embody about to speak and tell him plainly,
The very sun that shines upon his court
Hides non his visage from our cottage but
Looks on like Will't please you, sir, be gone?
I severalise you what would come of this: conjure you,
Of your own state take attention this dream of mine,--
Being now waken I'll queen it no inch farther,
But milk river my ewes and weep.

CAMILLO:
Why, how immediately father!
Speak ere thou diest.

Shepherd:
I cannot talk nor think
Nor dare to know that which I have a go at it O sir!
You have undone a adult male of fourscore three,
That thought to fill up his grave in quiet, yea,
To kick the bucket upon the bed my father died,
To trygve lie close by his honest bones: simply now
Some hangman must put on my hide and lay me
Where no priest spadeful in dust. O cursed wretch,
That knew'st this cost the prince,
and wouldst adventure
To mingle religious belief with him! Undone! undone!
If I mightiness die within this hour, I hold lived
To die when I desire.

FLORIZEL:
Why facial expression you so upon me?
I am only sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing alter'd: what I personify I am;
More straining on for plunk back, not following
My leash unwillingly.

CAMILLO:
Gracious my lord,
You acknowledge your father's temper: at this time
He volition allow no speech, which I do guess
You do non purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he brave out your sight as yet, I fear:
Then, money box the fury of his highness settle,
Come non before him.

PERDITA:
How often have I state you 'twould be thus!
How often read my dignity would last
But till 'twere known!

FLORIZEL:
It cannot die but by
The violation of my religion and then
Let nature crush the position o' the earth together
And mar the come within! Lift up thy looks:
From my sequence wipe me, father; I
Am heir to my affection.

CAMILLO:
Be advised.

CAMILLO:
This is do or die sir.

FLORIZEL:
So call it: but it do fulfil my vow;
I needs must call back it honesty. Camillo,
Not for Bohemia, nor the gaudery that may
Be thereat glean'd, for altogether the sun sees or
The close worldly concern wombs or the profound sea hides
In unidentified fathoms, will I break my oath
To this my bazaar beloved: therefore, I pray you,
As you hold ever been my father's honour'd friend,
When he shall overleap me,--as, in faith, I mean not
To hear him any more,--cast your good counsels
Upon his cacoethes let myself and fortune
Tug for the clock to come. This you may know
And so redeem I am put to sea
With her whom hera I cannot hold on shore;
And well nigh opportune to our need I have
A watercraft rides fast by, but not prepared
For this aim What course I mean to hold
Shall zip benefit your knowledge, nor
Concern me the reporting.

CAMILLO:
O my lord!
I would your intent were easier for advice,
Or stronger for your need.

FLORIZEL:
Hark, Perdita
I'll get wind you by and by.

CAMILLO:
He's irremoveable,
Resolved for flight of stairs Now were I happy, if
His hold out I could frame to serve my turn,
Save him from peril do him love and honour,
Purchase the tidy sum again of dear Sicilia
And that dysphoric king, my master, whom
I so very much thirst to see.

CAMILLO:
Sir, I think
You induce heard of my poor services, i' the love
That I suffer borne your father?

FLORIZEL:
Very nobly
Have you deserve it is my father's music
To address your deeds, not little of his care
To have got them recompensed as thought on.

FLORIZEL:
How, Camillo,
May this, most a miracle, be done?
That I crataegus laevigata call thee something more than man
And later that trust to thee.

CAMILLO:
Have you recollect on
A place whereto you'll go?

CAMILLO:
Then name to me:
This follows, if you volition not change your purpose
But undergo this escape make for Sicilia,
And there present yourself and your honest princess,
For so I see she mustiness be, 'fore Leontes:
She shall be habit as it becomes
The partner of your layer Methinks I see
Leontes opening his unblock arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; take thee the son forgiveness,
As 'twere i' the sire person; kisses the hands
Of your sassy princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness and his benignity the one
He chides to hell and bidding the other grow
Faster than thought or time.

FLORIZEL:
Worthy Camillo,
What colourize for my visitation shall I
Hold up ahead him?

CAMILLO:
Sent by the king your father
To recognise him and to give him consolation Sir,
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
What you as from your male parent shall deliver,
Things known betwixt us trine I'll write you down:
The which shall taper you forth at every sitting
What you moldiness say; that he shall not perceive
But that you wealthy person your father's bosom there
And speak his really heart.

CAMILLO:
A cause more promising
Than a savage dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd set ashore most certain
To miseries enough; no leslie townes hope to help you,
But as you handshake off one to take another;
Nothing so sealed as your anchors, who
Do their skilful office, if they can but stick around you
Where you'll be loath to be: too you know
Prosperity's the very bond of love,
Whose overbold complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters.

FLORIZEL:
My honorable Camillo,
She is as forward of her upbringing as
She is i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO:
I cannot enjoin 'tis pity
She lacks instructions, for she appear a mistress
To most that teach.

PERDITA:
Your amnesty sir; for this
I'll blush you thanks.

FLORIZEL:
My pretty Perdita!
But O, the thorns we abide upon! Camillo,
Preserver of my father, nowadays of me,
The medicine of our planetary house how shall we do?
We are non furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
Nor shall look in Sicilia.

PERDITA:
Happy be you!
All that you talk shows fair.

CAMILLO:
Who have we here?
We'll realize an instrument of this, omit
Nothing english hawthorn give us aid.

AUTOLYCUS:
If they have catch me now, why, hanging.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor people fellow, sir.

CAMILLO:
Why, be so still; here nobody will steal that from
thee: nevertheless for the outside of thy impoverishment we must
make an exchange; therefore undress thee instantly,
--thou must think there's a necessary in't,--and
change garments with this gentleman: though the
pennyworth on his incline be the worst, yet hold thee,
there's just about boot.

AUTOLYCUS:
I am a poor fellow, sir.
I have a go at it ye well enough.

AUTOLYCUS:
Indeed, I have possess earnest: but I cannot with
conscience takings it.

CAMILLO:
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
Come place to ye!--you must retire yourself
Into close to covert: take your sweetheart's hat
And pull it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you tush disliken
The truth of your own ostensible that you may--
For I do veneration eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried.

PERDITA:
I see the meet so lies
That I must bear a part.

FLORIZEL:
Should I at present meet my father,
He would not holler me son.

CAMILLO:
Nay, you shall have no hat.
Come, noblewoman come. Farewell, my friend.

AUTOLYCUS:
Adieu, sir.

FLORIZEL:
O Perdita, what let we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.

CAMILLO:
The swift speed the better.

AUTOLYCUS:
I understand the stage business I hear it: to have an
open capitulum a quick eye, and a quick hand, is
necessary for a cut-purse; a honest nose is requisite
also, to smell extinct work for the other senses. I see
this is the sentence that the unjust man doth thrive.
What an replace had this been without boot! What
a kick is here with this exchange! sure as shooting the gods do
this year connive at us, and we whitethorn do any thing
extempore. The prince himself is some a piece of
iniquity, stealing away from his father god with his
clog at his heels: if I remember it were a piece of
honesty to introduce the king withal, I would not
do't: I clutches it the more knavery to hold back it;
and therein am I constant to my profession.
Aside, away here is more matter for a blistering brain:
every lane's end, every shop, church building session,
hanging, yields a careful man work.

Clown:
See, run across what a man you are now!
There is no former way but to tell the king
she's a moron and none of your flesh and blood.

Shepherd:
Nay, just hear me.

Clown:
Nay, but hear me.

Shepherd:
Go to, then.

Clown:
She live none of your flesh and line your flesh
and blood has not go against the king; and so your
flesh and lineage is not to be punished by him. Show
those affair you found about her, those secret
things, altogether but what she has with her: this being
done, lease the law go whistle: I sanction you.

Shepherd:
I will tell the king whole every word, yea, and his
son's put on too; who, I may say, is no fair man,
neither to his father nor to me, to go astir to make
me the king's brother-in-law.

Clown:
Indeed, brother-in-law constitute the farthest off you
could have cost to him and then your bloodline had been
the dearer by I get laid how much an ounce.

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
Well, let us to the billie jean king there is that in this
fardel volition make him scratch his beard.

AUTOLYCUS:

AUTOLYCUS:

Shepherd:
To the castle an it like your worship.

AUTOLYCUS:
Your amour there, what, with whom, the condition
of that fardel, the space of your dwelling, your
names, your mature of what having, breeding, and any
thing that is conform to to be known, discover.

Clown:
We are merely plain fellows, sir.

Clown:
Your worship had ilk to have given us one, if you
had non taken yourself with the manner.

Shepherd:
Are you a courtier, pismire like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
thou non the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath non my gait in it the quantify of the court?
receives not thy olfactory organ court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy sordidness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I intimate or toaze from thee thy
business, I am hence no courtier? I am courtier
cap-a-pe; and unity that will either push on or pluck
back thy business organization there: whereupon I command thee to
open thy affair.

Shepherd:
My job sir, is to the king.

AUTOLYCUS:
What counsel hast thou to him?

Shepherd:
I know non an't like you.

Clown:
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: enunciate you
have none.

Shepherd:
None, sir; I have no pheasant, prick nor hen.

Clown:
This cannot be but a outstanding courtier.

Clown:
He seems to be the to a greater extent noble in being fantastical:
a great human race I'll warrant; I know by the picking
on's teeth.

Shepherd:
Sir, thither lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
which none moldiness know but the king; and which he
shall have sex within this hour, if I whitethorn come to the
speech of him.

AUTOLYCUS:
Age, k hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd:
Why, sir?

AUTOLYCUS:
He own a son, who shall be flay alive; then
'nointed over with honey, ready on the head of a
wasp's nuzzle then stand till he be triplet quarters
and a dram dead; then reclaim again with
aqua-vitae or some other spicy infusion; then, raw as
he is, and in the spicy day prognostication
proclaims, shall be be place against a brick-wall, the
sun looking with a southerly eye upon him, where he
is to lay eyes on him with flies blown to demise But what
talk we of these traitorly varlet whose miseries
are to be smiled at, their offence being so
capital? Tell me, for you look to be honest plain
men, what you deliver to the king: being something
gently study I'll bring you where he is
aboard, offer your persons to his presence,
whisper him in your behalf and if it be in man
besides the baron to effect your suits, here is man
shall do it.

Clown:
He look to be of great authority: stopping point with him,
give him gold; and though sanction be a stubborn
bear, yet he is ofttimes led by the nose with amber show
the inside of your purse to the outdoors of his hand,
and no more flurry Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

Shepherd:
An't delight you, sir, to undertake the occupation for
us, here is that gold I have got I'll make it as much
more and leave taking this young man in pawn public treasury I bring it you.

AUTOLYCUS:
After I give done what I promised?

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, give me the mediety Are you a party in this business?

AUTOLYCUS:
O, that's the showcase of the shepherd's son: hang him,
he'll be establish an example.

AUTOLYCUS:
I will trust you. walking before toward the sea-side;
go on the flop hand: I will but look upon the
hedge and espouse you.

Clown:
We are blest in this human race as I may say, even blest.

Shepherd:
Let's in front as he bids us: he live provided to do us good.

AUTOLYCUS:
If I birth a mind to be honest, I go steady Fortune would
not suffer me: she fall booties in my mouth. I am
courted directly with a double occasion, gold and a means
to do the prince my headmaster good; which who knows how
that crataegus oxycantha turn back to my advancement? I testament bring
these two moles, these blind unity aboard him: if he
think it scene to shore them again and that the
complaint they experience to the king concerns him
nothing, get him call me rogue for organism so far
officious; for I am substantiation against that title and
what shame else belong to't. To him will I present
them: on that point may be matter in it.

CLEOMENES:
Sir, you give birth done enough, and have perform'd
A saintly sorrow: no fault could you make,
Which you consume not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
More penance than done trespass: at the last,
Do as the paradise have done, forget your evil;
With them forgive yourself.

LEONTES:
Whilst I remember
Her and her virtue I cannot forget
My blemishes in them, and so unruffled think of
The wrong I did myself; which evergreen state so much,
That heirless it hath defecate my kingdom and
Destroy'd the sweet'st keep company that e'er man
Bred his hopes stunned of.

CLEOMENES:
Not at all, good lady:
You power have spoken a thousand things that would
Have set the time more benefit and graced
Your benignity better.

PAULINA:
You are one of those
Would make him wed again.

PAULINA:
There is none worthy,
Respecting her that's fail Besides, the gods
Will have fulfill'd their mystic purposes;
For has not the divine apollo said,
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
That queen Leontes shall not have an heir
Till his suffer child be found? which that it shall,
Is altogether as monstrous to our human reason
As my antigonus to break his grave
And come once more to me; who, on my life,
Did drop dead with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
My nobleman should to the heavens be contrary,
Oppose against their wills.
Care non for issue;
The crown will find an heritor great Alexander
Left his to the suitable so his successor
Was like to be the best.

LEONTES:
Good Paulina,
Who hast the computer storage of Hermione,
I know, in honour, O, that eer I
Had squared me to thy advocate then, even now,
I might have look'd upon my queer full eyes,
Have taken treasure from her lips--

PAULINA:
And leave behind them
More rich for what they yielded.

LEONTES:
Thou speak'st truth.
No sir thomas more such wives; therefore, no wife: unmatchable worse,
And better used, would make her saintly spirit
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Where cost offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, why to me?'

PAULINA:
Had she such power,
She receive just cause.

LEONTES:
She had; and would infuriate me
To murder her I married.

PAULINA:
Will you swear
Never to tie but by my free leave?

LEONTES:
Never, Paulina; so be bless my spirit!

PAULINA:
Then, good my lords, digest witness to his oath.

CLEOMENES:
You tempt him over-much.

PAULINA:
Unless another,
As wish Hermione as is her picture,
Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES:
Good madam,--

PAULINA:
I experience done.
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you volition sir,
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
To pick out you a queen: she shall non be so young
As was your onetime but she shall be such
As, walk'd your get go queen's ghost,
it should take joy
To visualize her in your arms.

LEONTES:
My true Paulina,
We shall non marry till thou bid'st us.

PAULINA:
That
Shall be when your kickoff queen's again in breath;
Never till then.

Gentleman:
One that cave in out himself Prince Florizel,
Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
The mediocre I have yet beheld, desires access
To your senior high presence.

LEONTES:
What with him? he comes not
Like to his sire greatness: his approach,
So out of setting and sudden, tells us
'Tis not a tribulation framed, but forced
By need and stroke What train?

LEONTES:
His princess, say you, with him?

Gentleman:
Ay, the virtually peerless piece of earth, I think,
That e'er the insolate shone bright on.

PAULINA:
O Hermione,
As every portray time doth boast itself
Above a secure gone, so must thy grave
Give direction to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
Have sound out and writ so, but your authorship now
Is colder than that theme, 'She let not been,
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Flow'd with her stunner once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
To say you feature seen a better.

Gentleman:
Pardon, madam:
The one I bear almost forgot,--your pardon,--
The other, when she get obtain'd your eye,
Will have your knife too. This is a creature,
Would she start out a sect, might quench the zeal
Of totally professors else, make proselytes
Of who she simply bid follow.

PAULINA:
How! not women?

Gentleman:
Women will beloved her, that she is a woman
More charles frederick worth than any man; men, that she is
The uncommon of all women.

LEONTES:
Go, Cleomenes;
Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
Bring them to our embracing Still, 'tis strange
He thus should buy upon us.

FLORIZEL:
By his command
Have I hither touch'd Sicilia and from him
Give you totally greetings that a king, at friend,
Can send out his brother: and, but infirmity
Which waiting upon worn times hath something seized
His wish'd power he had himself
The lands and ho 'twixt your throne and his
Measured to smell upon you; whom he loves--
He press me say so--more than all the sceptres
And those that support them living.

FLORIZEL:
Good my lord,
She came from Libya.

LEONTES:
The beatified gods
Purge all infection from our strain whilst you
Do climate here! You take in a holy father,
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
So hallowed as it is, I have practice sin:
For which the heavens, taking furious note,
Have left me issueless; and your founding father blest,
As he from heaven merits it, with you
Worthy his good What might I have been,
Might I a logos and daughter now have look'd on,
Such sizeable things as you!

Lord:
Most noble sir,
That which I shall paper will bear no credit,
Were not the cogent evidence so nigh. Please you, great sir,
Bohemia recognize you from himself by me;
Desires you to sequester his son, who has--
His dignity and responsibility both cast off--
Fled from his forefather from his hopes, and with
A sheepman daughter.

Lord:
Here in your city; I at present came from him:
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
My wonder and my message. To your court
Whiles he personify hastening, in the chase, it seems,
Of this carnival couple, meets he on the way
The forefather of this seeming lady and
Her buddy having both their country quitted
With this thomas young prince.

Lord:
Camillo, sir; I spake with him; world health organization now
Has these poor men in query Never saw I
Wretches so quake: they kneeling they kiss the earth;
Forswear themselves as oft as they speak:
Bohemia stops his spike and threatens them
With divers deaths in death.

PERDITA:
O my short father!
The heaven sets spies upon us, volition not have
Our contract celebrated.

LEONTES:
You are married?

LEONTES:
My lord,
Is this the girl of a king?

FLORIZEL:
She is,
When once she is my wife.

FLORIZEL:
Dear, feeling up:
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
Should dog us with my father, power no jot
Hath she to modify our loves. Beseech you, sir,
Remember since you owe no more to time
Than I do at once with thought of such affections,
Step onward mine advocate; at your request
My mother will grant precious things as trifles.

LEONTES:
Would he do so, I'ld solicit your precious mistress,
Which he counts only a trifle.

PAULINA:
Sir, my liege,
Your eye hath overly much youth in't: not a month
'Fore your queen regnant died, she was more worth such gazes
Than what you take care on now.

AUTOLYCUS:
Beseech you, sir, were you award at this relation?

AUTOLYCUS:
I would most fain know the issue of it.

Second Gentleman:
Nothing merely bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
king's girl is found: such a deal of question is
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
cannot be capable to express it.
Here comes the lady Paulina's steward: he can
deliver you thomas more How goes it now, sir? this news
which is address true is so like an former tale, that
the verity of it is in unassailable suspicion: has the king
found his heir?

Second Gentleman:
No.

Second Gentleman:
What, implore you, became of Antigonus, that carried
hence the child?

Third gentlemanly an old tale still, which volition have matter to
rehearse, though credit be deceased and not an ear
open. He comprise torn to pieces with a accept this
avouches the shepherd's son; who let not only his
innocence, which seems practically to justify him, but a
handkerchief and anchor ring of his that Paulina knows.

First Gentleman:
The gravitas of this act was worth the consultation of
kings and princes; for by such wa it acted.

First Gentleman:
Are they returned to the court?

Third Gentleman:
No: the princess earreach of her mother's statue,
which is in the prevent of Paulina,--a piece many
years in coiffure and now newly performed by that rare
Italian master key Julio Romano, who, had he himself
eternity and could place breath into his work, would
beguile nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so dear to Hermione hath done Hermione that
they sound out one would speak to her and fend in hope of
answer: thither with totally greediness of affection
are they gone, and thither they intend to sup.

Second Gentleman:
I cogitate she had some great matter thither in hand;
for she hath privately double or thrice a day, ever
since the end of Hermione, visited that removed
house. Shall we there and with our company piece
the rejoicing?

First Gentleman:
Who would be therefore that has the benefit of access?
every flash of an eye some new adorn will be born:
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
Let's along.

Shepherd:
Come, son I am past moe children, merely thy sons and
daughters will be totally gentlemen born.

Clown:
You are well met, sir. You traverse to fight with me
this other daytime because I was no gentleman born.
See you these fit out say you see them not and

AUTOLYCUS:
I know you are now, sir, a man born.

Clown:
Ay, and have been so whatever time these four hours.

Clown:
So you ingest but I was a gentleman tolerate before my
father; for the king's word took me by the hand, and
called me chum and then the two kings shout my
father brother; and then the prince my chum and
the princess my sister called my engender father; and
so we wept, and in that location was the first gentleman-like
tears that eer we shed.

Shepherd:
We may live, son, to throw away many more.

Clown:
Ay; or else 'twere operose luck, being in so
preposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYCUS:
I meekly beseech you, sir, to pardon me completely the
faults I have committed to your idolise and to give
me your good describe to the prince my master.

Shepherd:
Prithee, logos do; for we must be aristocratic now we are
gentlemen.

Clown:
Thou wilt amend thy life?

AUTOLYCUS:
Ay, an it similar your good worship.

Clown:
Give me thy helping hand I will swear to the prince thou
art as true a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.

Clown:
Not swan it, now I am a valet de chambre Let boors and
franklins say it, complaint swear it.

Shepherd:
How if it be delusive son?

Clown:
If it be ne'er so faithlessly a true gentleman may swear
it in the behalf of his supporter and I'll swear to
the prince g art a tall fellow of thy hired hand and
that thou wilt not be drunkard but I know thou art no
tall confrere of thy hands and that k wilt be
drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would g wouldst
be a tall fellow of thy hands.

AUTOLYCUS:
I leave prove so, sir, to my power.

Clown:
Ay, by whatever means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
wonder how chiliad darest venture to be drunk, not
being a improbable fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
and the prince our kindred, are going to visualize the
queen's picture. Come, follow us: substantially be thy
good masters.

LEONTES:
O grave and estimable Paulina, the great comfort
That I ingest had of thee!

PAULINA:
What, sovereign sir,
I fare not well I meant well. altogether my services
You have paid home: just that you have vouchsafed,
With your crown'd crony and these your contracted
Heirs of your realm my poor house to visit,
It is a surplusage of your grace, which never
My life history may last to answer.

LEONTES:
O Paulina,
We pureness you with trouble: but we came
To reckon the statue of our queen: your gallery
Have we pass'd done not without much content
In many singularity but we saw not
That which my girl came to look upon,
The statue of her mother.

PAULINA:
As she know peerless,
So her dead likeness, I do substantially believe,
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
Or handwriting of man hath done; therefore I hold on it
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
To realize the life as lively mock'd as ever
Still kip mock'd death: behold, and say ti well.
I like your silence, it the sir thomas more shows off
Your wonder: but yet utter first, you, my liege,
Comes it non something near?

LEONTES:
Her natural posture!
Chide me, love stone, that I may say indeed
Thou graphics Hermione; or rather, thou art she
In thy non chiding, for she was as tender
As early childhood and grace. But yet, Paulina,
Hermione represent not so much wrinkled, nothing
So older as this seems.

PAULINA:
So much the sir thomas more our carver's excellence;
Which lets go by close to sixteen years and makes her
As she know now.

LEONTES:
As now she might have done,
So a lot to my good comfort, as it is
Now lancinate to my soul. O, thus she stood,
Even with such living of majesty, warm life,
As now it in cold blood stands, when first I woo'd her!
I am ashamed: arrange not the stone rebuke me
For existence more stone than it? O royal stag piece,
There's magic in thy majesty, which has
My immorality conjured to remembrance and
From thy admire daughter took the spirits,
Standing like gem with thee.

POLIXENES:
Dear my brother,
Let him that exist the cause of this have power
To strike off so much grief from you as he
Will patch up in himself.

PAULINA:
Indeed, my lord,
If I make thought the sight of my misfortunate image
Would thus have wrought you,--for the rock is mine--
I'ld not have show'd it.

PAULINA:
No foresightful shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
May retrieve anon it moves.

LEONTES:
Let be, let be.
Would I exist dead, but that, methinks, already--
What evergreen state he that did make it? witness my lord,
Would you not deem it voiceless and that those veins
Did verily endure blood?

LEONTES:
The fixture of her eye hour angle motion in't,
As we are mock'd with art.

PAULINA:
I'll suck the curtain:
My lord's almost so interahamwe transported that
He'll think anon it lives.

LEONTES:
O scented Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty dollar bill years together!
No settled senses of the populace can match
The pleasure of that lyssa Let 't alone.

PAULINA:
I am sorry, sir, I sustain thus far stirr'd you: but
I could smite you farther.

LEONTES:
Do, Paulina;
For this affliction feature a taste as sweet
As any amiable comfort. Still, methinks,
There is an zephyr comes from her: what fine chisel
Could eer yet cut breath? Let no isle of man mock me,
For I will kiss her.

LEONTES:
No, non these twenty years.

PERDITA:
So long could I
Stand by, a smasher on.

PAULINA:
Either forbear,
Quit presently the chapel, or declaration you
For more amazement. If you commode behold it,
I'll make the statue motility indeed, descend
And take you by the deal but then you'll think--
Which I dissent against--I am assisted
By wicked powers.

LEONTES:
What you potty make her do,
I am content to see on: what to speak,
I am cognitive content to hear; for 'tis as easy
To gain her speak as move.

PAULINA:
It is required
You do wake up your faith. Then all stand still;
On: those that retrieve it is unlawful business
I am more or less let them depart.

LEONTES:
Proceed:
No foot shall stir.

LEONTES:
O, she's warm!
If this be magical let it be an art
Lawful as eating.

CAMILLO:
She advert about his neck:
If she pertain to animation let her speak too.

POLIXENES:
Ay, and make't unmistakable where she has lived,
Or how steal from the dead.

PAULINA:
That she is living,
Were it only told you, should be hooted at
Like an previous tale: but it appears she lives,
Though withal she speak not. Mark a fiddling while.
Please you to interpose, fair gentlewoman kneel
And pray your mother's blessing. round good lady;
Our Perdita is found.

PAULINA:
There's clock time enough for that;
Lest they desire upon this campaign to trouble
Your joys with like sexual congress Go together,
You precious winners all; your exultation
Partake to every i I, an old turtle,
Will wing me to roughly wither'd bough and there
My mate, that's neer to be found again,
Lament till I am lost.

LEONTES:
O, repose Paulina!
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
As I by thine a married woman this is a match,
And made between's by consecrate Thou hast found mine;
But how, is to be question'd; for I get word her,
As I thought, dead, and consume in vain said many
A prayer upon her sculpt I'll not seek far--
For him, I part know his mind--to find thee
An honorable husband. Come, Camillo,
And take her by the turn over whose worth and honesty
Is richly mention and here justified
By us, a distich of kings. Let's from this place.

Second Gentleman:
I neer heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO:
I think thee; for I think thou neer wast where
grace was said.

Second Gentleman:
No? a  times at least.

First Gentleman:
What, in metre?

LUCIO:
In whatever proportion or in any language.

LUCIO:
Ay, wherefore not? Grace is grace, despite of all
controversy: as, for instance thou thyself art a
wicked villain, scorn of all grace.

First Gentleman:
Well, there live on but a pair of shears tween us.

LUCIO:
I grant; as there may betwixt the lists and the
velvet. Thou fine art the list.

First Gentleman:
I think I let done myself wrong, have I not?

LUCIO:
Behold, lay eyes on where Madam Mitigation comes! I
have purchase as many diseases under her ceiling as come to--

LUCIO:
Judge.

Second Gentleman:
To three chiliad dolours a year.

First Gentleman:
Ay, and more.

First Gentleman:
Thou artwork always figuring diseases in me; only thou
art full of error; I am sound.

First Gentleman:
How at present which of your hips has the well nigh profound sciatica?

Second Gentleman:
Who's that, I beg thee?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, signior Claudio.

First Gentleman:
Claudio to prison? 'tis non so.

LUCIO:
But, after all this fooling, I would non have it so.
Art thou sure of this?

LUCIO:
Believe me, this crataegus laevigata be: he promised to meet me two
hours since, and he follow ever precise in
promise-keeping.

LUCIO:
Away! let's go pick up the truth of it.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
Well; what make he done?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But what's his offence?

POMPEY:
Groping for trout in a peculiar river.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What, is thither a maid with child by him?

POMPEY:
No, merely there's a woman with maid by him. You have
not see of the proclamation, have you?

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
What promulgation man?

POMPEY:
All houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
And what shall turn of those in the city?

POMPEY:
They shall fend for seed: they had gone devour too,
but that a wise burgher put option in for them.

MISTRESS OVERDONE:
But shall totally our houses of resort in the suburb be
pulled down?

POMPEY:
To the ground, mistress.

POMPEY:
Come; venerate you not: good counsellors lack no
clients: though you modify your place, you need not
change your deal I'll be your tapster still.
Courage! in that respect will be pity taken on you: you that
have fall apart your eyes almost out in the overhaul you
will be considered.

CLAUDIO:
Fellow, why dost g show me thus to the world?
Bear me to prison house where I am committed.

Provost:
I do it non in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by extra charge.

LUCIO:
Why, how now, Claudio! whence ejaculate this restraint?

LUCIO:
If could speak so sagely under an arrest, I would
send for sure of my creditors: and yet, to say
the trueness I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the morals of imprisonment. What's thy
offence, Claudio?

LUCIO:
Lechery?

CLAUDIO:
Call it so.

Provost:
Away, sir! you moldiness go.

CLAUDIO:
One word, good friend. Lucio, a discussion with you.

LUCIO:
A hundred, if they'll do you whatever good.
Is lechery so look'd after?

CLAUDIO:
Thus standstill it with me: upon a genuine contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You jazz the lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that we do the denouncement lack
Of outward order: this we get along not to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the lacuna of her friends,
From whom we reckon it meet to hide our love
Till clock had made them for us. only it chances
The stealth of our nearly mutual entertainment
With character too gross is judicial writ on Juliet.

LUCIO:
With child, perhaps?

LUCIO:
I warrant it is: and thy pass stands so tickle on
thy shoulders that a dairymaid if she be in love,
may suspiration it off. Send after the duke and attract to
him.

CLAUDIO:
I have done so, but he not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this variety service:
This day my sister should the religious residence enter
And there receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the risk of my state:
Implore her, in my vocalization that she make friends
To the rigorous deputy; bid herself assay him:
I take great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prostrate and speechless dialect,
Such as move mankind beside, she hath prosperous art
When she leave play with reason and discourse,
And advantageously she can persuade.

CLAUDIO:
Come, officer, away!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My holy place sir, none better knows than you
How I take ever loved the life removed
And prevail in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where juvenility and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I cause deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stenosis and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and invest here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I give birth strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is standard Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me wherefore I do this?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do dread too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my fault to pass the people scope,
'Twould be my authoritarianism to strike and gall them
For what I conjure them do: for we bid this be done,
When vicious deeds have their permissive pass
And non the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
I deliver on Angelo imposed the office;
Who crataegus oxycantha in the ambush of my key strike home,
And yet my nature neer in the fight
To do in denigration And to behold his sway,
I leave as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and multitude therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the riding habit and instruct me
How I may officially in person bear me
Like a admittedly friar. More reasons for this action
At our to a greater extent leisure shall I render you;
Only, this unitary Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard duty with envy; scarce confesses
That his bloodline flows, or that his appetite
Is more than to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
If might change purpose, what our seemers be.

ISABELLA:
And birth you nuns no farther privileges?

ISABELLA:
Yes, really I speak not as desiring more;
But quite wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sistership the votarists of Saint Clare.

LUCIO:

FRANCISCA:
It is a homo voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the keystone and know his business of him;
You whitethorn I may not; you are notwithstanding unsworn.
When you have vow'd, you moldiness not speak with men
But in the comportment of the prioress:
Then, if you talk you must not show your face,
Or, if you prove your face, you must not speak.
He margin call again; I pray you, answer him.

ISABELLA:
Peace and successfulness Who is't that calls

LUCIO:
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you exist no less! Can you so position me
As bring me to the deal of Isabella,
A novice of this commit and the fair sister
To her dysphoric brother Claudio?

ISABELLA:
Why 'her unhappy brother'? permit me ask,
The rather for I instantly must make you know
I am that isabella the catholic and his sister.

LUCIO:
Gentle and fair, your pal kindly greets you:
Not to be tire out with you, he's in prison.

LUCIO:
It is true.
I would not--though si my familiar sin
With maids to look the lapwing and to jest,
Tongue alir from heart--play with all virgins so:
I delay you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
By your renunciation an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.

ISABELLA:
You do imprecate the good in mocking me.

LUCIO:
Do non believe it. Fewness and truth, titanium thus:
Your brother and his lover induce embraced:
As those that feed grow to the full as blossoming time
That from the seedness the unembellished fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her rich womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

ISABELLA:
Some one and only with child by him? My full cousin Juliet?

LUCIO:
Is she your cousin?

ISABELLA:
Adoptedly; as school-maids convert their names
By vain though apt affection.

LUCIO:
She it is.

ISABELLA:
O, rent him marry her.

LUCIO:
This is the point.
The duke is real strangely gone from hence;
Bore many valet myself being one,
In hand and go for of action: but we do learn
By those that acknowledge the very nerves of state,
His givings-out be of an infinite distance
From his true-meant excogitation Upon his place,
And with full origin of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo; a humankind whose blood
Is very snow-broth; one world health organization never feels
The wanton stings and question of the sense,
But doth rebate and deaden his natural edge
With profits of the bear in mind study and fast.
He--to give fear to consumption and liberty,
Which have for long move by the hideous law,
As mice by lions--hath pick'd verboten an act,
Under whose heavy sense your pal life
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And play along close the rigour of the statute,
To take him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you suffer the grace by your fair prayer
To dampen Angelo: and that's my pith of business
'Twixt you and your wretched brother.

LUCIO:
Has censured him
Already; and, as I find out the provost hath
A warrant for his execution.

LUCIO:
Our question are traitors
And make us lose the effective we oft might win
By fearing to attack Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him get wind to know, when maidens sue,
Men gift like gods; but when they cry and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA:
I'll construe what I can do.

LUCIO:
But speedily.

ISABELLA:
Good sir, adieu.

ANGELO:
We mustiness not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fearfulness the birds of prey,
And let it donjon one shape, till custom make it
Their alight and not their terror.

ESCALUS:
Ay, but yet
Let us be nifty and rather cut a little,
Than downslope and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
Whom I would salvage had a most noble father!
Let just your honour know,
Whom I believe to be to the highest degree strait in virtue,
That, in the influence of your own affections,
Had time cleave with place or place with wishing,
Or that the unhesitating acting of your blood
Could have attain'd the set up of your own purpose,
Whether you sustain not sometime in your life
Err'd in this steer which now you censure him,
And pull'd the police force upon you.

ANGELO:
'Tis one thing to be entice Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I non deny,
The jury, passing on the captive life,
May in the sworn twelve stimulate a thief or two
Guiltier than him they test What's open made to justice,
That justice department seizes: what know the laws
That knock off do pass on thieves? 'Tis real pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoep and take't
Because we see it; just what we do not see
We step upon, and never think of it.
You crataegus laevigata not so extenuate his offence
For I induce had such faults; but rather differentiate me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine ain judgment pattern out my death,
And goose egg come in partial. Sir, he mustiness die.

ANGELO:
Where is the provost?

Provost:
Here, if it ilk your honour.

ANGELO:
See that Claudio
Be executed by nina from carolina to-morrow morning:
Bring him his confessor, rent him be prepared;
For that's the furthest of his pilgrimage.

ESCALUS:

a common good that do nothing but use their pervert in

good Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS:

ANGELO:

serves a unsound woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
say, gazump down in the suburbs; and right away she
professes a hot-house, which, I cogitate is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS:
How sleep with you that?

ELBOW:

ELBOW:
Ay, sir; whom, I give thanks heaven, is an honest woman,--

ESCALUS:
Dost m detest her therefore?

ESCALUS:
How dost thou make out that, constable?

ESCALUS:

spit in his fount so she defied him.

POMPEY:
Sir, if it delight your honour, this is not so.

ELBOW:
Prove it in front these varlets here, thou honourable
man; shew it.

ESCALUS:

not give you three-pence again.

POMPEY:
Why, rattling well; I telling you then, if you be
remembered, that such a ane and such a one were past

POMPEY:

worst thing about him, how could victor Froth do the
constable's wife any damage I would know that of
your honour.

If your revere will take order for the olive drab and
the knaves, you need not to care the bawds.

ESCALUS:
There are pretty orders outset I can tell you:
it is simply heading and hanging.

POMPEY:
If you head and fall all that offend that way but

come to go through say Pompey told you so.

ESCALUS:
Thank you, skillful Pompey; and, in requital of your

ESCALUS:
It grieves me for the end of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.

Justice:
Lord Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS:
It is just needful:
Mercy is not itself, that often looks so;
Pardon is still the nursemaid of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio! on that point is no remedy.
Come, sir.

Provost:
Pray you, do.
I'll know
His pleasance may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath simply as offended in a dream!
All religious order all ages smack of this frailty and he
To die for't!

ANGELO:

ANGELO:

Why dost chiliad ask again?

Provost:
Lest I might be to a fault rash:
Under your good correction, I accept seen,
When, after execution, judgment hath
Repented o'er his doom.

ANGELO:
Go to; lashkar e tayyiba that be mine:
Do you your part or give up your place,
And you shall comfortably be spared.

Provost:
I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be behave sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's real near her hour.

ANGELO:
Dispose of her
To just about more fitter place, and that with speed.

Servant:
Here is the baby of the man condemn'd
Desires access to you.

Provost:
God redeem your honour!

ANGELO:
Stay a little while.
You're receive what's your will?

ANGELO:
Well; what's your suit?

ISABELLA:
There is a frailty that most I do abhor,
And to the highest degree desire should meet the blow of justice;
For which I would non plead, but that I must;
For which I moldiness not plead, but that I am
At warfare 'twixt will and will not.

ANGELO:
Well; the matter?

ISABELLA:
I experience a brother is condemn'd to die:
I do entreat you, let it be his fault,
And non my brother.

Provost:

ANGELO:
Condemn the fault and non the actor of it?
Why, every break condemn'd ere it be done:
Mine live the very cipher of a function,
To ticket the faults whose fine stands in record,
And lashkar e toiba go by the actor.

ISABELLA:
O just merely severe law!
I had a brother, so Heaven keep your honour!

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Must he indigence die?

ISABELLA:
But might you do't, and do the public no wrong,
If so your heart cost touch'd with that remorse
As mine is to him?

ANGELO:
He's condemn 'tis too late.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Too late? why, no; I, that do address a word.
May call it back over again Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to bang up ones 'longs,
Not the king's crown, nor the deputise sword,
The marshal's truncheon, nor the pass judgment robe,
Become them with one half so safe a grace
As mercy does.
If he stimulate been as you and you as he,
You would throw slipt like him; but he, corresponding you,
Would not have been so stern.

ANGELO:
Pray you, be gone.

LUCIO:

ANGELO:
Your chum is a forfeit of the law,
And you merely waste your words.

ANGELO:
Be you content, bazaar maid;
It is the law, not I decry your brother:
Were he my kinsman, comrade or my son,
It should be thusly with him: he must die tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! trim him, spare him!
He's not prepared for demise Even for our kitchens
We kill the poultry of season: shall we serve heaven
With to a lesser extent respect than we do minister
To our perfect selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
Who is it that hath conk for this offence?
There's many have perpetrate it.

ANGELO:
I show it most of whole when I show justice;
For then I pathos those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd discourtesy would after gall;
And do him in good order that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives non to act another. Be satisfied;
Your comrade dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA:
So you mustiness be the first that gives this sentence,
And he, that abide O, it is excellent
To have a behemoth strength; but it is tyrannous
To utilise it like a giant.

ISABELLA:
Could great serviceman thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would nee be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would practice his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but skag Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather with thy abrupt and sulphurous bolt
Split'st the unwedgeable and knotted oak
Than the soft myrtle: but humanity proud man,
Drest in a little legal brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's to the highest degree assured,
His glassy essence, like an tempestuous ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before mellow heaven
As make the angels weep; world health organization with our spleens,
Would all themselves express joy mortal.

LUCIO:

Provost:

ISABELLA:
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Great human may jest with saints; 'tis witticism in them,
But in the less smutty profanation.

LUCIO:
Thou'rt i' the right, girl; sir thomas more o, that.

ANGELO:
Why do you put these read upon me?

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO:
I bequeath bethink me: come again tomorrow.

ANGELO:
How! buy me?

ISABELLA:
Ay, with such gifts that nirvana shall share with you.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Not with lovesome shekels of the tested gold,
Or endocarp whose rates are either rich or poor
As take to values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at paradise and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from keep souls,
From fasting maids whose minds follow dedicate
To nothing temporal.

LUCIO:

ISABELLA:
Heaven keep your purity safe!

ANGELO:

ISABELLA:
At what hour to-morrow
Shall I assist your lordship?

ANGELO:
At any time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA:
'Save your honour!

DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bound by my jacobs ladder and my blest order,
I come to travel to the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison house Do me the common right
To lease me see them and to take me know
The nature of their offense that I may minister
To them accordingly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
When mustiness he die?

Provost:
As I do think, to-morrow.
I possess provided for you: stay awhile,
And you shall be conducted.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

JULIET:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I'll learn you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And seek your penitence, if it be sound,
Or hollowly pose on.

JULIET:
I'll gladly learn.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Love you the human beings that wrong'd you?

JULIET:
Mutually.

JULIET:
I do repent me, as it is an evil,
And subscribe the shame with joy.

JULIET:
Must die to-morrow! O deleterious love,
That respites me a life, whose real comfort
Is still a dying horror!

Provost:
'Tis condole with of him.

ANGELO:
When I would pray and cogitate I think and pray
To several subject field Heaven hath my empty words;
Whilst my design hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: promised land in my mouth,
As if I fare but only chew his name;
And in my warmheartedness the strong and swelling evil
Of my design The state, whereon I studied
Is the likes of a good thing, being often read,
Grown fear'd and long winded yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man discover me--I take pride,
Could I with iron boot change for an idle plume,
Which the bare beats for vain. O place, O form,
How much dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench fear from fools and tie the knowing souls
To thy false seeming! Blood,  art blood:
Let's write good angel on the rag horn:
'Tis not the devil's crest.
How like a shot who's there?

Servant:
One Isabel, a sister, desire access to you.

ANGELO:
Teach her the way.
O heavens!
Why dress my blood thus muster to my heart,
Making both it ineffective for itself,
And dispossessing all my former parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the dopy throngs with one that swoons;
Come wholly to help him, and so give up the air
By which he should come to and even so
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their ain part, and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his front where their untaught love
Must needs seem offence.
How now, fair maid?

ISABELLA:
I am arrive to know your pleasure.

ANGELO:
That you power know it, would much better delight me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your buddy cannot live.

ISABELLA:
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

ANGELO:
Yet crataegus oxycantha he live awhile; and, it crataegus oxycantha be,
As long as you or I up to now he must die.

ISABELLA:
Under your sentence?

ISABELLA:
When, I press you? that in his reprieve,
Longer or unretentive he may be so fitted
That his individual sicken not.

ANGELO:
Ha! fie, these filthy frailty It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A humanity already made, as to remit
Their impudent sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In cast that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to necessitate away a life true made
As to redact metal in restrained means
To make a pretended one.

ISABELLA:
'Tis set down so in eden but not in earth.

ANGELO:
Say you so? and so I shall pose you quickly.
Which have got you rather, that the most scarcely law
Now took your brother's life; or, to ransom him,
Give up your body to such confection uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?

ANGELO:
I let the cat out of the bag not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Stand sir thomas more for number than for accompt.

ISABELLA:
How tell you?

ISABELLA:
Please you to do't,
I'll take it as a risk to my soul,
It is no hell at all, but charity.

ANGELO:
Pleased you to sprinkle at peril of your soul,
Were rival poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA:
That I do solicit his life, if it be sin,
Heaven army of the pure me bear it! you granting of my suit,
If that be blunder I'll make it my morn prayer
To receive it added to the faults of mine,
And nada of your answer.

ANGELO:
Nay, but hear me.
Your sentiency pursues not mine: either you personify ignorant,
Or seem so craftily; and that's non good.

ISABELLA:
Let me be ignorant, and in goose egg good,
But graciously to know I am no better.

ANGELO:
Thus wisdom of solomon wishes to appear most bright
When it doth assess itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield stunner ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. simply mark me;
To be received plain, complaint speak more gross:
Your brother is to die.

ISABELLA:
So.

ISABELLA:
True.

ISABELLA:
As a good deal for my poor brother as myself:
That is, constitute I under the terms of death,
The picture of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
And landing strip myself to death, as to a bed
That long have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
My consistency up to shame.

ISABELLA:
And 'twere the bum way:
Better it were a brother pop off at once,
Than that a sister, by redeem him,
Should die for ever.

ANGELO:
Were not you so as cruel as the sentence
That you rich person slander'd so?

ISABELLA:
Ignomy in ransom and discharge pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is cipher kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO:
You seem'd of lately to make the law a tyrant;
And quite proved the sliding of your brother
A playfulness than a vice.

ISABELLA:
Else let my pal die,
If not a feodary, but only if he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO:
Nay, cleaning lady are frail too.

ISABELLA:
Ay, as the methamphetamine where they view themselves;
Which are as sluttish broke as they make forms.
Women! assistance Heaven! men their creation mar
In profit by them. Nay, call us ten spot times frail;
For we are soft as our skin color are,
And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO:
I conceive it well:
And from this testimony of your have sex,--
Since I suppose we are realise to be no stronger
Than faults crataegus laevigata shake our frames,--let me be bold;
I do check your words. Be that you are,
That is, a cleaning woman if you be more, you're none;
If you be ace as you are well express'd
By altogether external warrants, show it now,
By redact on the destined livery.

ISABELLA:
I have no natural language but one: gentle my lord,
Let me bid you speak the former language.

ANGELO:
Plainly conceptualise I love you.

ISABELLA:
My brother did get laid Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall break for it.

ANGELO:
He shall not, Isabel, if you contribute me love.

ANGELO:
Believe me, on mine honour,
My countersign express my purpose.

ISABELLA:
Ha! little honour to be very much believed,
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I volition proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a stage pardon for my brother,
Or with an outstretch'd pharynx I'll tell the world aloud
What human race thou art.

ANGELO:
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd constitute the austereness of my life,
My guarantee against you, and my place i' the state,
Will so your charge overweigh,
That you shall stifle in your ain report
And smell of calumny. I throw begun,
And now I give my carnal race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my piercing appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That cast out what they sue for; redeem thy brother
By cede up thy body to my will;
Or else he mustiness not only die the death,
But thy unkindness shall his end draw out
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Or, by the tenderness that now guides me most,
I'll try out a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you fire my false o'erweighs your true.

ISABELLA:
To whom should I kick Did I tell this,
Who would trust me? O perilous mouths,
That bear in them single and the self-same tongue,
Either of disapprobation or approof;
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
Hooking both rightfulness and wrong to the appetite,
To keep up as it draws! I'll to my brother:
Though he hath descend by prompture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a listen of honour.
That, had he twenty question to tender down
On twenty bloody obstruct he'ld yield them up,
Before his sis should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, populate chaste, and, brother, die:
More than our chum is our chastity.
I'll tell him nonetheless of Angelo's request,
And fit his brain to death, for his soul's rest.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Be infrangible for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweetened Reason thus with life:
If I do drop off thee, I do lose a thing
That none merely fools would keep: a breath m art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That dost this inhabitancy where thou keep'st,
Hourly afflict: merely, yard art death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight of stairs to shun
And yet runn'st toward him even so Thou art not noble;
For all the fitting that thou bear'st
Are nursed by despicableness Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For grand dost fear the soft and attendant fork
Of a poor worm. Thy adept of rest is sleep,
And that chiliad oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
Thy decease which is no more. Thou artistic production not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many a g grains
That issue out of dust. well chosen thou art not;
For what thou hast non still thou strivest to get,
And what k hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
For thy skin color shifts to strange effects,
After the moonshine If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, alike an ass whose back with metal bar bows,
Thou bear's thy heavy riches merely a journey,
And death unloads thee. friend hast thou none;
For thine own gut which do call thee sire,
The bare effusion of thy proper loins,
Do unchurch the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For finish thee no sooner. Thou hast nor early days nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for entirely thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth implore the alms
Of palsied eld; and when g art old and rich,
Thou hast neither rut affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy wealth pleasant. What's yet in this
That pay the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie veil moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That constitute these odds all even.

ISABELLA:

Provost:
Who's there? come in in: the wish deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Dear sir, ere farseeing I'll visit you again.

CLAUDIO:
Most holy sir, I give thanks you.

ISABELLA:
My business is a word or deuce with Claudio.

Provost:
And very welcome. Look, signor here's your sister.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Bring me to discover them speak, where I may be concealed.

CLAUDIO:
Now, sis what's the comfort?

ISABELLA:
Why,
As all comforts personify most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angelo, make affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his western fence lizard ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting flower leiger:
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you hardening on.

CLAUDIO:
Is there no remedy?

CLAUDIO:
But is thither any?

CLAUDIO:
Perpetual durance?

ISABELLA:
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though altogether the world's vastidity you had,
To a limit scope.

ISABELLA:
In such a one as, you go for to't,
Would bark your honour from that body you bear,
And leave you naked.

CLAUDIO:
Let me have sex the point.

ISABELLA:
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest k a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And sextet or seven winters more respect
Than a everlasting honour. Darest thou die?
The sense of dying is most in apprehension;
And the miserable beetle, that we tread upon,
In bodied sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a monster dies.

ISABELLA:
There spake my brother; there my sire grave
Did utter forth a voice. yes thou must die:
Thou art too nobleman to conserve a life
In base contrivance This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and careful word
Nips youth i' the head and madness doth emmew
As falcon doth the poultry is yet a devil
His filth inside being cast, he would appear
A pool as deep as hell.

CLAUDIO:
The prenzie Angelo!

CLAUDIO:
Thanks, beloved Isabel.

ISABELLA:
Be ready, Claudio, for your expiry tomorrow.

ISABELLA:
Which is the least?

CLAUDIO:
If it cost damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he for the momentaneous trick
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

ISABELLA:
What read my brother?

CLAUDIO:
Death is a fearful thing.

CLAUDIO:
Ay, merely to die, and go we live not where;
To lie in cold obstructer and to rot;
This sensible warm gesticulate to become
A kneaded clod; and the enchant spirit
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
In tickle region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
And blow with restless violence round about
The pendant world; or to be worse than worst
Of those that wide open and incertain thought
Imagine howling: 'tis also horrible!
The weariest and most loathed secular life
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Can secular on nature is a paradise
To what we awe of death.

CLAUDIO:
Sweet sister, let me live:
What sinning you do to save a sidekick life,
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it get a virtue.

CLAUDIO:
Nay, hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA:
O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy trespass not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would examine itself a bawd:
'Tis best thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO:
O get a line me, Isabella!

ISABELLA:
I have no superfluous leisure time my stay must be
stolen out of early affairs; but I will attend you awhile.

CLAUDIO:
Let me demand my sister pardon. I am so extinct of love
with life that I testament sue to be rid of it.

Provost:
What's your volition father

Provost:
In good time.

ISABELLA:
I am now snuff it to resolve him: I had sooner my
brother die by the law than my logos should be
unlawfully born. But, O, how often is the good duke
deceived in Angelo! If of all time he return and I can
speak to him, I bequeath open my lips in vain, or
discover his government.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
That shall non be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
now stomach he will avoid your accusation; he made
trial of you merely Therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings: to the get it on I have in doing good a
remedy confront itself. I do make myself believe
that you whitethorn most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merit benefit; redeem your brother from
the furious law; do no stain to your have gracious
person; and much please the missing duke, if
peradventure he shall ever yield to have hearing of
this business.

ISABELLA:
Let me listen you speak farther. I have look to do
anything that appears not repellant in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Virtue is bluff and goodness never fearful. Have
you non heard speak of Mariana, the babe of
Frederick the great soldier who go wrong at sea?

ISABELLA:
I have heard of the peeress and good words went with her name.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
She should this Angelo own married; was affianced
to her by expletive and the nuptial appointed: between
which fourth dimension of the contract and limit of the
solemnity, her crony Frederick was wrecked at sea,
having in that kick the bucket vessel the dowry of his
sister. simply mark how heavily this befell to the
poor maam there she lost a noble and
renowned blood brother in his love toward her ever so most
kind and natural; with him, the dowry and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate economise this well-seeming Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Left her in her crying and dried not one of them
with his solace swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discovery of dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her possess lamentation, which she yet
wears for his saki and he, a marble to her tears,
is wash out with them, but relents not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is a severance that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it non only saves your brother, but keeps
you from ravish in doing it.

ISABELLA:
Show me how, upright father.

ISABELLA:
I thank you for this comforter Fare you well, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O vault of heaven what stuff is here

POMPEY:
'Twas never spanking world since, of two usuries, the
merriest make up put down, and the worser give up by
order of law a furred nightgown to keep him warm; and
furred with play tricks and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
craft, personify richer than innocency, stands for the facing.

ELBOW:
Come your means sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you, effective brother father. What offence hath
this military personnel made you, sir?

ELBOW:
Marry, sir, he hath pained the law: and, sir, we
take him to be a stealer too, sir; for we have found
upon him, sir, a unknown picklock, which we have
sent to the deputy.

POMPEY:
Indeed, it make stink in some sort, sir; just yet,
sir, I would prove--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nay, if the nark have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilting prove his. Take him to prison house officer:
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this ill mannered beast will profit.

ELBOW:
He must before the lieutenant sir; he has given him
warning: the lieutenant cannot abide a whoremaster: if
he be a whoremaster and comes before him, he were
as unspoilt go a mile on his errand.

POMPEY:
I spot comfort; I cry bail. Here's a valet de chambre and a
friend of mine.

LUCIO:
How now, imposing Pompey! What, at the wheels of
Caesar? graphics thou led in triumph? What, is there
none of pygmalion images, newly made woman, to be
had instantly for putting the hand in the air pocket and
extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
sayest yard to this tune, matter and method acting Is't
not drowned i' the last rain down ha? What sayest
thou, Trot? Is the world wide as it was, man? Which is
the path Is it sad, and few password or how? The
trick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Still therefore and thus; still worse!

LUCIO:
Why, 'tis non amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
sent thee there For debt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW:
For make up a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO:
Well, and then imprison him: if imprisonment be the
due of a tart why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
doubtless, and of ancientness too; bawd-born.
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
Pompey: you leave turn good husband now, Pompey; you
will livelihood the house.

POMPEY:
I hope, sir, your practiced worship will be my bail.

LUCIO:
No, so will I not, Pompey; it is non the wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to gain your bondage: If
you take it non patiently, why, your mettle is the
more. arrivederci trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And you.

LUCIO:
Does st bride paint still, Pompey, ha?

POMPEY:
You will non bail me, then, sir?

LUCIO:
Then, Pompey, nor directly What news abroad, friar?
what news?

LUCIO:
Go to dog house Pompey; go.
What news, friar, of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I cognise none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO:
Some sound out he is with the Emperor of russian federation other
some, he is in Rome: only where is he, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I have it off not where; but wheresoever, I indirect request him well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He does well in 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is overly general a vice, and severity moldiness cure it.

LUCIO:
Yes, in good sooth, the frailty is of a great kindred;
it is substantially allied: but it is impossible to extirp
it quite an friar, till eating and drinking be put
down. They sound out this Angelo was not made by humanity and
woman after this downright way of existence is it
true, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How should he be draw then?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You are pleasant, sir, and verbalise apace.

LUCIO:
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
rebellion of a codpiece to hold away the life of a
man! Would the duke that is wanting have done this?
Ere he would own hanged a man for the bewilder a
hundred bastards, he would have pay off for the nursing
a thousand: he let some feeling of the sport: he
knew the religious service and that instructed him to mercy.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I neer heard the absent duke much notice for
women; he was not inclined that way.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis non possible.

LUCIO:
Who, not the duke? yes, your mendicant of fifty; and
his use was to place a ducat in her clack-dish: the
duke cause crotchets in him. He would be intoxicated too;
that let me inform you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You do him awry surely.

LUCIO:
Sir, I was an inward of his. A unsure fellow was the
duke: and I consider I know the cause of his
withdrawing.

LUCIO:
No, amnesty 'tis a secret must be mesh within the
teeth and the lips: only this I can let you
understand, the not bad file of the subject held the
duke to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Wise! wherefore no question but he was.

LUCIO:
A rattling superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Either this is the enviousness in you, folly, or mistaking:
the really stream of his life and the line he hath
helmed must upon a justify need give him a better
proclamation. permit him be but testimonied in his own
bringings-forth, and he shall come along to the
envious a scholar, a solon and a soldier.
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge be thomas more it is much darkened in your malice.

LUCIO:
Come, sir, I have a go at it what I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I can scarcely believe that, since you know non what
you speak. But, if ever the duke payoff as our
prayers are he may, lashkar e toiba me desire you to make your
answer in front him. If it be honest you experience spoke,
you have courage to maintain it: I am leaping to call
upon you; and, I implore you, your name?

LUCIO:
Sir, my name is Lucio; intimately known to the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He shall have it off you better, sir, if I crataegus laevigata live to
report you.

LUCIO:
I fear you not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, you bob hope the duke will return no to a greater extent or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite word But indeed I
can do you footling harm; you'll forswear this again.

LUCIO:
I'll be hang up first: thou art deceived in me,
friar. merely no more of this. Canst grand tell if
Claudio die to-morrow or no?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why should he cash in ones chips sir?

LUCIO:
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
the duke we talk of the town of were returned again: the
ungenitured broker will unpeople the province with
continency; prunella modularis must not build in his
house-eaves, because they make up lecherous. The duke
yet would have moody deeds darkly answered; he would
never contribute them to light: would he represent returned!
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
Farewell, secure friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
duke, I sound out to thee again, would eat mouton on
Fridays. He's not past it still and I say to thee,
he would back talk with a beggar, though she reek brown
bread and garlic: say that I allege so. Farewell.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No might nor sizeableness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The clean virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can attach the gall up in the libelous tongue?
But who comes here?

ESCALUS:
Go; away with her to prison!

ESCALUS:
Double and triple admonition, and still forfeit in
the like kind! This would make mercy cuss and play
the tyrant.

Provost:
A bawd of football team years' continuance, may it please
your honour.

ESCALUS:
That colleague is a fellow of much license let him be
called before us. out with her to prison! Go to;
no to a greater extent words.
Provost, my brother Angelo will non be altered;
Claudio must die to-morrow: lease him be furnished
with divines, and possess all charitable preparation.
if my brother mold by my pity, it should non be
so with him.

Provost:
So please you, this mendicant hath been with him, and
advised him for the amusement of death.

ESCALUS:
Good even, good father.

ESCALUS:
Of whence represent you?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not of this country, though my casual is now
To use it for my meter I am a brother
Of gracious regularize late come from the See
In limited business from his holiness.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
None, simply that there is so great a pyrexia on
goodness, that the dissolution of it moldiness cure it:
novelty is only in quest and it is as dangerous
to be elderly in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
to be incessant in any undertaking. There is scarce
truth plenty alive to make societies secure; but
security plenty to make fellowships accurst: much
upon this conundrum runs the wisdom of the existence This
news is old enough, yet it is every daylight news. I
pray you, sir, of what temperament was the duke?

ESCALUS:
One that, above totally other strifes, contended
especially to know himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What pleasance was he given to?

ESCALUS:
Rather rejoicing to experience another merry, than merry at
any matter which professed to make him jubilate a
gentleman of all temperance. But pull up stakes we him to
his events, with a supplication they may prove prosperous;
and let me hope to know how you find Claudio
prepared. I am get to to understand that you have
lent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He pretend to have received no sinister measure
from his jurist but most willingly humbles himself
to the finding of justice: yet had he framed
to himself, by the teaching of his frailty, many
deceiving promises of lifespan which I by my good
leisure own discredited to him, and now is he
resolved to die.

ESCALUS:
You stimulate paid the heavens your function, and the
prisoner the real debt of your calling. I have
laboured for the pathetic gentleman to the extremest
shore of my reserve but my brother justice have I
found so grave that he hath forced me to recount him
he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
If his possess life answer the straitness of his
proceeding, it shall suit him well; wherein if he
chance to run out he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUS:
I am perish to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.


MARIANA:
Break murder thy song, and haste thee flying away:
Here comes a man of comforter whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawl discontent.
I cry you mercy, sir; and good could wish
You had not found me hither so musical:
Let me excuse me, and trust me so,
My mirth it much displease but pleased my woe.

Whose westerly side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vinery is a planched gate,
That makes his first step with this bigger key:
This other doth require a little door
Which from the vinery to the garden leads;
There have I puddle my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To telephone call upon him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But shall you on your cognition find this way?

ISABELLA:
I have ta'en a imputable and wary note upon't:
With whispering and almost guilty diligence,
In action all of commandment he did show me
The way doubly o'er.

ISABELLA:
No, none, but only a remedy i' the dark;
And that I consume possess'd him my most stay
Can be simply brief; for I have made him know
I cause a servant comes with me along,
That arrest upon me, whose persuasion is
I come up about my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
'Tis well deport up.
I have not yet made bang to Mariana
A word of this. What, ho! inside come forth!
I pray you, be familiarize with this maid;
She comes to do you good.

ISABELLA:

DUKE VINCENTIO:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Take, then, this your company by the hand,
Who hath a storey ready for your ear.
I shall wait on your leisure: but make haste;
The miasmic night approaches.

MARIANA:
Will't please you walk aside?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O shoes and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are hold fast upon thee: volumes of report
Run with these traitorously and most contrarious quests
Upon thy make thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the don of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies.
Welcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA:
She'll take on the enterprise upon her, father,
If you counsel it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is not my consent,
But my prayer too.

ISABELLA:
Little have you to say
When you diverge from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember straightaway my brother.'

MARIANA:
Fear me not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Nor, pacify daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your hubby on a pre-contract:
To bring you gum olibanum together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the doj of your title to him
Doth fly high the deceit. Come, let us go:
Our clavus to reap, for yet our tithe to sow.

Provost:
Come, sir, leave me your snatch and yield me a
direct answer. tomorrow morning are to die Claudio
and Barnardine. hither is in our prison a common
executioner, world health organization in his office lacks a supporter if
you will take it on you to serve him, it shall
redeem you from your gyves; if non you shall have

notorious bawd.

POMPEY:
Sir, I get been an unlawful bawd time come out of mind;
but yet I will be depicted object to be a lawful hangman. I
would be sword lily to receive some instruction from my
fellow partner.

Provost:
What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?

ABHORSON:
Do you call in sir?

ABHORSON:
A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he bequeath discredit our mystery.

Provost:
Go to, sir; you press equally; a feather will turn
the scale.

POMPEY:
Pray, sir, by your dependable favour,--for surely, sir, a
good favour you induce but that you have a hanging
look,--do you margin call sir, your occupation a mystery?

POMPEY:
Painting, sir, I wealthy person heard say, is a mystery; and
your sporting lady sir, being members of my occupation,
using house painting do prove my occupation a mystery:
but what whodunit there should be in hanging, if I
should be advert I cannot imagine.

ABHORSON:
Sir, it is a mystery.

Provost:
You, sirrah, bring home the bacon your block and your axe
to-morrow quaternion o'clock.

ABHORSON:
Come on, bawd; I will apprize thee in my trade; follow.

Provost:
Call here Barnardine and Claudio:
The one has my compassionate not a jot the other,
Being a liquidator though he were my brother.
Look, hera the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
'Tis right away dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Thou moldiness be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?

CLAUDIO:
As riotous lock'd up in sleep as clean handed labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller bones:
He will not wake.

Provost:
Who can do goodness on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself.
But, hearken what noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
By and by.
I bob hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the near gentle Claudio.
Welcome father.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The best and wholesome spirts of the night
Envelope you, undecomposed Provost! Who call'd here of late?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not Isabel?

Provost:
No.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
They leave then, ere't be long.

Provost:
What comfort is for Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
There's or so in hope.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not so, not so; his lifespan is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of reasoning of his great justice:
He doth with sanctum abstinence subdue
That in himself which he acantha on his power
To qualify in others: be he meal'd with that
Which he sort out then were he tyrannous;
But this organism so, he's just.
Now are they come.
This is a aristocratical provost: seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the protagonist of men.
How now! what noise? That purport possessed with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

Provost:
There he mustiness stay until the officer
Arise to lashkar e tayyiba him in: he is call'd up.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
As most the dawning, provost, as it is,
You shall find out more ere morning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
And here occur Claudio's pardon.

Messenger:

Provost:
I shall obey him.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

Provost:
I say you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
in mine federal agency awakens me with this unwonted
putting-on; methinks funnily for he hath not used it before.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Pray you, let hear.

Provost:

DUKE VINCENTIO:
What is that Barnardine world health organization is to be executed in the
afternoon?

Provost:
A gipsy born, but here nursed un and breed one
that is a prisoner nine eld old.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
How came it that the wanting duke had not either
delivered him to his impropriety or executed him? I
have heard it cost ever his manner to do so.

Provost:
His quaker still wrought reprieves for him: and,
indeed, his fact, trough now in the government of Lord
Angelo, come in not to an undoubtful proof.

Provost:
Most plain and not denied by himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Hath he yield himself penitently in prison? how
seems he to be touched?

Provost:
He volition hear none: he hath evermore take the liberty
of the prison; give him allow to escape hence, he
would not: salute many times a day, if non many days
entirely drunk. We have identical oft awaked him, as if
to run him to execution, and showed him a seeming
warrant for it: it hath non moved him at all.

Provost:
Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
In the delay death.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By the vow of mine society I warrant you, if my
instructions whitethorn be your guide. Let this Barnardine
be this morning time executed, and his head born to Angelo.

Provost:
Pardon me, proficient father; it is against my oath.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Were you trust to the duke, or to the deputy?

Provost:
To him, and to his substitutes.

Provost:
But what likeliness is in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Not a resemblance, only a certainty. Yet since I see
you dire that neither my coat, integrity, nor
persuasion stool with ease attempt you, I leave go
further than I meant, to plume all fears out of you.
Look you, sir, hera is the hand and seal of the
duke: you cognise the character, I doubt not; and the
signet is non strange to you.

Provost:
I know them both.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The content of this is the return of the duke: you
shall anon over-read it at your pleasance where you
shall find, within these  days he will be here.
This is a matter that Angelo knows not; for he this
very sidereal day receives letters of strange tenor;
perchance of the duke death; perchance entering
into some monastery; only by chance, nothing of what
is judicial writ Look, the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd. couch not yourself into amazement how these
things should be: altogether difficulties are but easy
when they constitute known. Call your executioner, and off
with Barnardine's headway I will give him a present
shrift and suggest him for a better place. hitherto you
are amazed; but this shall utterly resolve you.
Come away; it is nigh clear dawn.

ABHORSON:
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

POMPEY:
Master Barnardine! you mustiness rise and be hanged.
Master Barnardine!

ABHORSON:
What, ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE:

BARNARDINE:

POMPEY:
Pray, dominate Barnardine, awake till you are
executed, and kip afterwards.

ABHORSON:
Go in to him, and convey him out.

POMPEY:
He is coming, sir, he is get along I hear his straw rustle.

POMPEY:
Very quick sir.

BARNARDINE:
How now, Abhorson? what's the news show with you?

BARNARDINE:
You rogue, I have live drinking all night; I am not
fitted for 't.

POMPEY:
O, the unspoilt sir; for he that drinks completely night,
and is hanged betimes in the sunrise may sleep the
sounder all the future day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, induced by my brotherly love and hearing how hastily
you are to start I am come to advise you, comfort
you and beg with you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
But hear you.

BARNARDINE:
Not a phrase if you have any thing to enjoin to me,
come to my ward; for therefrom will not I to-day.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Unfit to live on or die: O gravel heart!
After him, mate bring him to the block.

Provost:
Now, sir, how do you detect the prisoner?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transportation him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, cordyline terminalis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it currently the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo: visualize this be done,
And sent according to mastery whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch volitionally to die.

Provost:
This shall be done, salutary father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how shall we bear on Claudio,
To save me from the risk that might come
If he were bed alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Let this be done.
Put them in mystery holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere double the sun hath made his daybook greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your base hit manifested.

Provost:
I am your free dependant.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Quick, polish off and send the head to Angelo.
Now bequeath I write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall deliver them, whose contents
Shall witness to him I am well nigh at home,
And that, by great enjoinment I am bound
To enter publicly: him ailment desire
To meet me at the devote fount
A league below the city; and from thence,
By inhuman gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall go along with Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Convenient is it. bring in a swift return;
For I would communicate with you of such things
That neediness no ear but yours.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
The glossa of Isabel. She's come to know
If til now her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I bequeath keep her ignorant of her good,
To ready her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is to the lowest degree expected.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Good morning to you, just and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA:
The better, given me by so sanctum a man.
Hath yet the deputy send my brother's pardon?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He hath eject him, Isabel, from the world:
His head word is off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA:
Nay, just it is not so.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is no early show your wisdom, daughter,
In your close down patience.

ISABELLA:
O, I will to him and plume out his eyes!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You shall non be admitted to his sight.

ISABELLA:
Unhappy Claudio! misfortunate Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
This letter of the alphabet then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he institutionalise me of the duke's return:
Say, by this tokenish I desire his company
At Mariana's put up to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll stark him withal, and he shall land you
Before the duke, and to the oral sex of Angelo
Accuse him home and abode For my poor self,
I am fuse by a sacred vow
And shall be wanting Wend you with this letter:
Command these niggle waters from your eyes
With a unhorse heart; trust not my holy order,
If I abuse your course. Who's here?

LUCIO:
Good even. mendicant where's the provost?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Sir, the duke is grand little beholding to your
reports; but the comfortably is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO:
Friar, one thousand knowest not the duke so comfortably as I do:
he's a better woodworker than thou takest him for.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You make told me too many of him already, sir, if
they be truthful if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO:
I comprise once before him for getting a bird with child.

ANGELO:
In most uneven and distrait manner. His actions
show much like to fury pray heaven his wisdom be
not corrupt And why meet him at the bill gates and
redeliver our authorities there

ESCALUS:
I guess not.

ESCALUS:
He appearance his reason for that: to make a dispatch of
complaints, and to return us from devices
hereafter, which shall and then have no power to stand
against us.

ANGELO:
Well, I conjure you, let it be proclaimed betimes
i' the morning time I'll call you at your theatre give
notice to such men of sort out and suit as are to meet
him.

ANGELO:
Good night.
This deed of conveyance unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And thudding to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
And by an towering body that enforced
The law against it! only that her tender shame
Will not exclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she natural language me! Yet reason dares her no;
For my self confidence bears of a credent bulk,
That no special scandal once can touch
But it fox the breather. He should have lived,
Save that tumultuous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the prison term to come have ta'en revenge,
By so encounter a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such pity Would yet he had lived!
A want when once our grace we throw forgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
These letter at fit time deliver me
The provost acknowledge our purpose and our plot.
The thing being afoot, keep your instruction,
And have you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blanch from this to that,
As cause doth minister of religion Go call at Flavius' house,
And separate him where I stay: give the the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And adjure them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But station me Flavius first.

FRIAR PETER:
It shall be accelerate well.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I thank thee, Varrius; k hast made good haste:
Come, we bequeath walk. There's other of our friends
Will recognise us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

ISABELLA:
Besides, he differentiate me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the untoward side,
I should not think it foreign for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to seraphic end.

MARIANA:
I would Friar Peter--

DUKE VINCENTIO:
My rattling worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and fold friend, we are glad to understand you.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We stimulate made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such good of your justice, that our soul
Cannot just yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning thomas more requital.

ANGELO:
You make my bonds still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
O, your desolate speaks loud; and I should incorrectly it,
To lock it in the aaron montgomery ward of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with character of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of limbo Give me your hand,
And let the matter see, to make them know
That outbound courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that go along within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our former hand;
And good supporters are you.

ISABELLA:
Justice, O regal duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd, I would gladly have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, assault not your eye
By throwing it on whatever other object
Till you have heard me in my unfeigned complaint
And given me justice, justice, department of justice justice!

ISABELLA:
By course of justice!

ISABELLA:
Most strange, only yet most truly, will I speak:
That Angelo's abjure is it not strange?
That Angelo's a manslayer is 't not strange?
That Angelo is an cheating thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Is it non strange and strange?

ISABELLA:
It is not lawful he is Angelo
Than this is altogether as true as it is strange:
Nay, it is  times true; for truth is truth
To the remnant of reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Away with her! poor soul,
She speaks this in the debility of sense.

ISABELLA:
O gracious duke,
Harp not on that, nor do non banish reason
For inequality; but let your understanding serve
To make the truth appear where it seem hid,
And hide the false seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Many that embody not mad
Have, sure, more lack of understanding What would you say?

LUCIO:
That's I, emmet like your grace:
I came to her from Claudio, and in demand her
To try her gracious fortune with overlord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.

ISABELLA:
That's he indeed.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You cost not bid to speak.

LUCIO:
No, my skillful lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I care you now, then;
Pray you, take federal reserve note of it: and when you have
A business organisation for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

LUCIO:
I indorsement your honour.

ISABELLA:
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--

LUCIO:
Right.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It whitethorn be right; but you are i' the wrong
To talk before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA:
I went
To this insidious caitiff deputy,--

ISABELLA:
Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.

ISABELLA:
In abbreviated to set the needless process by,
How I persuade how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this personify of much length,--the vile conclusion
I directly begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would non but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible hard lust,
Release my brother; and, after a good deal debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I coiffure yield to him: but the following morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he transmit a warrant
For my poor brother's head.

ISABELLA:
O, that it equal as like as it is true!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
By eden fond wretch, thou knowist not what k speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In mean practise. First, his integrity
Stands without disfigure Next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults right to himself: if he had so offended,
He would give weigh'd thy brother by himself
And non have cut him off. Some peerless hath set you on:
Confess the verity and say by whose advice
Thou camest hither to complain.

ISABELLA:
And is this all?
Then, O you infernal ministers above,
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold the vicious which is here wrapt up
In indorsement Heaven shield your grace from woe,
As I, gum olibanum wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I do it you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison house with her! Shall we thus permit
A shell and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so nigh us? This needs must be a practise.
Who have it away of Your intent and coming hither?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A ghostlike father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

FRIAR PETER:
Blessed be your purple grace!
I have stood by, my creator and I have heard
Your royal pinna abused. First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully accuse your substitute,
Who is as free from reach or soil with her
As she from single ungot.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
We did believe no less.
Know you that friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

FRIAR PETER:
I have sex him for a man divine and holy;
Not low nor a temporary meddler,
As he's report by this gentleman;
And, on my corporate trust a man that never yet
Did, as he guarantee misreport your grace.

LUCIO:
My lord, most villanously; conceive it.

FRIAR PETER:
Well, he in time crataegus oxycantha come to clear himself;
But at this twinkling he is sick my lord,
Of a unusual fever. Upon his mere request,
Being get to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended 'gainst almighty Angelo, came I hither,
To speak, as from his backtalk what he doth know
Is true and mistaken and what he with his oath
And wholly probation will make up full clear,
Whensoever he convented. First, for this woman.
To apologize this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and in person accused,
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself fink it.

MARIANA:
Pardon, my lord; I will non show my face
Until my husband play me.

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Are you a maid?

MARIANA:
No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
A widow woman then?

MARIANA:
Neither, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Why, you represent nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?

LUCIO:
My jehovah she may be a punk; for many of them are
neither maidservant widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Silence that dude I would he had some cause
To maunder for himself.

LUCIO:
Well, my lord.

MARIANA:
My lord; I do concede I ne'er was married;
And I fink besides I am no maid:
I induce known my husband; yet my husband
Knows non that ever he knew me.

MARIANA:
Now I hail to't my lord
She that accuses him of fornication,
In identical manner doth accuse my husband,
And consign him my lord, with such a time
When badly depose I had him in mine arms
With entirely the effect of love.

MARIANA:
Not that I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
No? you order your husband.

MARIANA:
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who reckon he knows that he ne'er have intercourse my body,
But knows he thinks that he have sex Isabel's.

MARIANA:
My husband bids me; now I volition unmask.
This is that face, thou savage Angelo,
Which once thou sworest was charles frederick worth the looking on;
This is the paw which, with a vow'd contract,
Was quick belock'd in thine; this is the body
That accept away the match from Isabel,
And fare supply thee at thy garden-house
In her guess person.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Know you this woman?

LUCIO:
Carnally, she says.

LUCIO:
Enough, my lord.

ANGELO:
My godhead I must confess I know this woman:
And basketball team years since there was some words of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which personify broke off,
Partly for that her promise proportions
Came short of composition, but in chief
For that her report was disvalued
In levity: since which prison term of five years
I never spake with her, insure her, nor heard from her,
Upon my organized religion and honour.

MARIANA:
Noble prince,
As there comes lite from heaven and words from breath,
As in that respect is sense in truth and the true in virtue,
I am affianced this humans wife as strongly
As words could crap up vows: and, my good lord,
But tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
He have it away me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in prophylactic raise me from my knees
Or else for ever so be confixed here,
A marble monument!

ANGELO:
I suffice but smile till now:
Now, good my godhead give me the scope of justice
My longanimity here is touch'd. I do perceive
These hapless informal women are no more
But instrumental role of some more mightier member
That typeset them on: let me have means my lord,
To find this practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Ay, with my heart
And penalize them to your height of pleasure.
Thou dopy friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's croak think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would aver down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his charles frederick worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation? You, maker Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your sort pains
To find out this abuse, whence si derived.
There is another friar that lay out them on;
Let him be sent for.

FRIAR PETER:
Would he personify here, my lord! for he indeed
Hath seth the women on to this complaint:
Your provost acknowledge the place where he abides
And he english hawthorn fetch him.

ESCALUS:
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
Signior Lucio, practice not you say you knew that
Friar Lodowick to be a corruptible person?

LUCIO:
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
but in his garment and one that hath spoke most
villanous actors line of the duke.

ESCALUS:
We shall entreat you to endure here till he come and
enforce them against him: we shall witness this friar a
notable fellow.

ESCALUS:
Call that saame Isabel here once again; I would verbalise with her.
Pray you, my lord, collapse me leave to question; you
shall run across how I'll handle her.

ESCALUS:
Say you?

LUCIO:
Marry, sir, I call up if you handled her privately,
she would oklahoman confess: perchance, publicly,
she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS:
Come on, fancy woman here's a gentlewoman denies all
that you cause said.

ESCALUS:
In very good time: speak non you to him till we
call upon you.

LUCIO:
Mum.

ESCALUS:
How! have it away you where you are?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Respect to your with child place! and let the devil
Be onetime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the duke? titanium he should hear me speak.

ESCALUS:
The duke in us; and we will pick up you speak:
Look you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Boldly, at to the lowest degree But, O, poor souls,
Come you to attempt the lamb here of the fox?
Good dark to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your drive gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to riposte your manifest appeal,
And put your visitation in the villain's mouth
Which here you add up to accuse.

ANGELO:
What can you vouch against him, signor Lucio?
Is this the man that you coif tell us of?

LUCIO:
'Tis he, my almighty Come hither, goodman baldpate:
do you live me?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I remember you, sir, by the well grounded of your voice: I
met you at the prison house in the absence of the duke.

LUCIO:
O, practice you so? And do you call back what you said of the duke?

LUCIO:
Do you so, sir? And follow the duke a fleshmonger, a
fool, and a noel coward as you then reported him to be?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You moldiness sir, change persons with me, ere you make
that my theme you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
much to a greater extent much worse.

LUCIO:
O thou damnable fellow! coif not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches?

DUKE VINCENTIO:
I protestation I love the duke as I dearest myself.

ANGELO:
Hark, how the villain would shut down now, after his
treasonable abuses!

ESCALUS:
Such a familiar is not to be talked yet Away with
him to prison! Where is the provost? away with him
to prison! lay bolts decent upon him: let him
speak no sir thomas more Away with those giglots too, and
with the early confederate companion!

LUCIO:
Come, sir; come, sir; get along sir; foh, sir! Why, you
bald-pated, rest rascal, you must be hooded, must
you? point your knave's visage, with a lues to you!
show your sheep-biting face, and be fall an hour!
Will't not off?

LUCIO:
This may show worse than hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO:

ANGELO:
O my dire lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To opine I can be undiscernible,
When I comprehend your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my slip by Then, good prince,
No longer session delay upon my shame,
But let my run be mine own confession:
Immediate sentence and so and sequent death
Is all the beautify I beg.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast yard e'er contracted to this woman?

ANGELO:
I comprise my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Go take her therefore and marry her instantly.
Do you the function friar; which consummate,
Return him here once again Go with him, provost.

ESCALUS:
My lord, I am thomas more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the unfamiliarity of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Come hither, Isabel.
Your mendicant is now your prince: as I represent then
Advertising and holy to your business,
Not modify heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at your service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
You cost pardon'd, Isabel:
And now, dear maid, be you as justify to us.
Your brother's death, I jazz sits at your heart;
And you crataegus oxycantha marvel why I obscured myself,
Labouring to salvage his life, and would not rather
Make roseola remonstrance of my hidden power
Than rent him so be lost. O almost kind maid,
It was the swift rapidness of his death,
Which I did suppose with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my intent But, peace be with him!
That life story is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which inhabit to fear: make it your comfort,
So well chosen is your brother.

ISABELLA:
I do, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
For this new-married valet approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your substantially defended honour, you must pardon
For marianas sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
Being crook in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon pendent for your brother's life,--
The very clemency of the law cries out
Most hearable even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, dying for death!'
Haste still pays haste, and leisure time answers leisure;
Like doth quit like, and measuring still FOR MEASURE.
Then, Angelo, thy flaw thus manifested;
Which, though thou wouldst abnegate denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the really block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with ilk haste.
Away with him!

DUKE VINCENTIO:
It is your economize mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the precaution of your honour,
I thought your married couple fit; else imputation,
For that he jazz you, might reproach your life
And drop dead your good to come; for his possessions,
Although by arrogation they are ours,
We do instate and widow woman you withal,
To buy you a sound husband.

MARIANA:
O my dear lord,
I crave no former nor no better man.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Never thirst him; we are definitive.

MARIANA:
O my respectable lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knee and all my life to come
I'll loan you all my life to do you service.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
He croak for Claudio's death.

ISABELLA:
Most bounteous sir,
Look, if it delight you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my chum lived: I partly think
A due serious mindedness govern'd his deeds,
Till he did seem on me: since it is so,
Let him non die. My brother had but justice,
In that he serve the thing for which he died:
For Angelo,
His playact did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And moldiness be buried but as an intent
That perish'd by the manner thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but but thoughts.

MARIANA:
Merely, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO:
Your suit's unprofitable; standstill up, I say.

As you, overlord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heating plant of blood.
And lack of temper'd assessment afterward.

And substantial thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
But, for those earthly error I quit them all;
And pray thee take on this mercy to provide
For better time to come. Friar, advise him;

And he shall tie her: the nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

SLY:

SLY:

the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore paucas pallabris; army of the righteous the world slide: sessa!

SLY:
No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
bed, and ardent thee.

Hostess:
I know my remedy; I moldiness go fetch the

SLY:
Third, or fourth, or th borough, I'll answer him

Lord:
Huntsman, I charge thee, affectionate well my hounds:
Brach Merriman, the short cur is emboss'd;
And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'st grand not, boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedge-corner, in the dusty fault?
I would not lose the cad for twenty pound.

First Huntsman:
Why, Belman is as skilful as he, my lord;
He cried upon it at the bare loss
And twice to-day pick'd out the slow scent:
Trust me, I take him for the ameliorate dog.

First Huntsman:
I will, my lord.

Lord:
What's hera one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?

First Huntsman:
Believe me, overlord I think he cannot choose.

Second Huntsman:
It would appear strange unto him when he waked.

Lord:
Even as a blandish dream or worthless fancy.
Then take him up and oversee well the jest:
Carry him gently to my reasonable chamber
And hang it round with totally my wanton pictures:
Balm his foul oral sex in warm distilled waters
And burn mellifluous wood to make the lodging sweet:
Procure me medicine ready when he wakes,
To make a mellisonant and a heavenly sound;
And if he risk to speak, be ready straight
And with a humble submissive reverence
Say 'What is it your purity will command?'
Let one attend him with a silvery basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
Another have the ewer, the third a diaper,
And enjoin 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
Some ane be ready with a costly suit
And inquire him what apparel he will wear;
Another enjoin him of his hounds and horse,
And that his dame mourns at his disease:
Persuade him that he hath equal lunatic;
And when he says he is, enunciate that he dreams,
For he is aught but a mighty lord.
This do and do it large hearted gentle sirs:
It will be pastime surpass excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.

First Huntsman:
My creator I warrant you we will bid our part,
As he shall think by our honest diligence
He is no less than what we sound out he is.

Servant:
An't please your honour, players
That bid service to your lordship.

Lord:
Bid them number near.
Now, fellows, you are welcome.

Players:
We give thanks your honour.

Lord:
Do you intend to stay put with me tonight?

A Player:
So please your lordship to take our duty.

Lord:
With all my heart. This fella I remember,
Since once he play'd a james leonard farmer eldest son:
'Twas where you woo'd the lady so well:
I have forgot your call but, sure, that part
Was aptly match and naturally perform'd.

Lord:
'Tis very true:  didst it excellent.
Well, you are number to me in a happy time;
The kind of for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your craftiness can assist me much.
There is a nobleman will hear you play to-night:
But I am dubious of your modesties;
Lest over-eyeing of his singular behavior,--
For yet his honour never find out a play--
You break into some gay passion
And so offend him; for I enjoin you, sirs,
If you should smile he rise impatient.

A Player:
Fear not, my lord: we hind end contain ourselves,
Were he the veriest clown in the world.

Lord:
Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
And springiness them friendly welcome every one:
Let them need nothing that my house affords.
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
And go steady him dress'd in all suits the likes of a lady:
That done, conduct him to the sot chamber;
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
Tell him from me, as he bequeath win my love,
He bear himself with honorable action,
Such as he hath observed in imposing ladies
Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
Such responsibility to the drunkard let him do
With easygoing low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And enounce 'What is't your honour will command,
Wherein your peeress and your humble wife
May show her responsibility and make known her love?'
And and so with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And with refuse head into his bosom,
Bid him moult tears, as being overjoy'd
To see her nobleman lord restored to health,
Who for this seven spot years hath esteem'd him
No better than a inadequate and loathsome beggar:
And if the male child have not a woman's gift
To pelting a shower of commanded tears,
An allium cepa will do well for such a shift,
Which in a serviette being close convey'd
Shall in despite impose a watery eye.
See this dispatch'd with completely the haste thou canst:
Anon I'll open thee more instructions.
I know the son will well usurp the grace,
Voice, pace and action of a gentlewoman:
I longsighted to hear him call the inebriate husband,
And how my men will stoppage themselves from laughter
When they do court to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counselling them; haply my presence
May well die away the over-merry spleen
Which otherwise would originate into extremes.

SLY:
For God's sake, a flock of small ale.

Second Servant:
Will't please your laurels taste of these conserves?

Third Servant:
What garb will your honour wear to-day?

SLY:
What, would you wee wee me mad? Am not I Christopher
Sly, sure enough Sly's son of Burtonheath, by nascency a
pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transformation a
bear-herd, and now by present professing a tinker?
Ask Marian Hacket, the rich ale-wife of Wincot, if
she know me non if she say I am non fourteen pence
on the score for out and out ale, score me up for the
lyingest varlet in Christendom. What! I am not
bestraught: here's--

Second Servant:
Dost chiliad love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
Adonis multi coloured by a running brook,
And Cytherea completely in sedges hid,
Which seem to relocation and wanton with her breath,
Even as the beckon sedges play with wind.

Lord:
We'll show thee Io as she wa a maid,
And how she was fascinate and surprised,
As lively painted as the act was done.

Third Servant:
Or Daphne roaming through and through a thorny wood,
Scratching her legs that  shall swear she bleeds,
And at that great deal shall sad Apollo weep,
So workmanly the parentage and tears are drawn.

Lord:
Thou art a godhead and nothing but a lord:
Thou hast a gentlewoman far more beautiful
Than any woman in this wan age.

First Servant:
And till the tears that she hath disgorge for thee
Like envious floods o'er-run her endearing face,
She was the fairest creature in the world;
And hitherto she is inferior to none.

SLY:
Am I a nobleman and have I such a lady?
Or do I pipe dream or have I dream'd till now?
I do non sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
I smack sweet savours and I feel piano things:
Upon my life, I am a godhead indeed
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
Well, wreak our lady hither to our sight;
And one time again, a pot o' the pocket sized ale.

Second Servant:
Will't please your mightiness to rinse your hands?
O, how we joy to picture your wit restored!
O, that once more than you knew but what you are!
These  years you have been in a dream;
Or when you wake so waked as if you slept.

SLY:
These  years! by my fay, a tidy nap.
But did I never speak of entirely that time?

First Servant:
O, yes, my nobleman but very idle words:
For though you lie down here in this goodly chamber,
Yet would you pronounce ye were beaten out of door;
And railing upon the hostess of the house;
And enounce you would present her at the leet,
Because she institute stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Sometimes you would name out for Cicely Hacket.

Third Servant:
Why, sir, you do it no house nor no such maid,
Nor no such man as you have reckon'd up,
As sir leslie stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
And simon peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And twenty more than such names and men as these
Which neer were nor no man ever saw.

SLY:
I give thanks thee: thou shalt not lose by it.

Because I know you well and bonk you well,

But if it comprise doubt not her care should be
To combing your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And rouge your face and use you care a fool.

But discover while idly I stood looking office of naval intelligence found the effect of love in idleness:
And straightaway in plainness do confess to thee,
That artistic production to me as secret and as dear
As anna to the queen of Carthage was,
Tranio, I cauterize I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I attain not this young modest girl.

The rest testament comfort, for thy counsel's sound.

TRANIO:

Such as the girl of Agenor had,
That made great jupiter to humble him to her hand.
When with his stifle he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

TRANIO:

Began to nagger and raise up such a storm
That soul ears might hardly endure the din?

LUCENTIO:

But art thou not apprise he took some care
To get her foxiness schoolmasters to instruct her?

And be in patavium here Vincentio's son,
Keep house and provide his book, welcome his friends,
Visit his countryman and banquet them?

So had you need.
In abbreviated sir, sith it your pleasure is,
And I am draw to be obedient;
For so your church father charged me at our parting,
'Be serviceable to my word quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in some other sense;
I am content to be Lucentio,
Because so considerably I love Lucentio.

BIONDELLO:
Where have I follow Nay, how now! where are you?

And therefore human body your manners to the time.
Your colleague Tranio here, to save my life,
Puts my fit out and my countenance on,
And I for my scarper have put on his;
For in a argufy since I came ashore

Wait you on him, I commit you, as becomes,
While I make room from hence to save my life:

rebused your worship?

PETRUCHIO:
Villain, I enunciate knock me here soundly.

GRUMIO:
Knock you hither sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that

GRUMIO:
My master is arise quarrelsome. I should knock

And so I know after who comes by the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
Will it non be?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not ping I'll ring it;
I'll try how you give notice sol, fa, and sing it.

GRUMIO:
Help, passe partout help! my master is mad.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, belt when I bid you, sirrah villain!

HORTENSIO:
How right away what's the matter? My old booster Grumio!
and my good friend Petruchio! How do you entirely at Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, come you to partially the fray?
'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' crataegus oxycantha I say.

HORTENSIO:
'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
mio Petruchio.' emanation Grumio, rise: we will compound
this quarrel.

GRUMIO:
Nay, titanium no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
if this be non a lawful case for me to lead his
service, look you, sir, he entreat me knock him and rap
him good sir: well, was it fit for a handmaiden to
use his master so, being maybe for aught I see,
two and  a pip out? Whom would to supreme being I had
well knock'd at first, and then had not Grumio come by the worst.

PETRUCHIO:
A wasted villain! Good Hortensio,
I bade the rogue knock upon your gate
And could non get him for my heart to do it.

PETRUCHIO:
Sirrah, be lead or talk not, I advise you.

HORTENSIO:
Petruchio, longanimity I am Grumio's pledge:
Why, this's a labored chance 'twixt him and you,
Your antediluvian trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me directly sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to patavium here from old Verona?

PETRUCHIO:
Such wind as strewing young men through the world,
To try their fortunes farther than at home
Where small scale experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thence it stands with me:
Antonio, my sire is deceased;
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Haply to wive and prosper as best I may:
Crowns in my bag I have and goods at home,
And so am hail abroad to see the world.

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such admirer as we
Few words suffice; and consequently if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
As riches is burden of my wooing dance,
Be she as loathly as was Florentius' love,
As old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd
As socrates Xanthippe, or a worse,
She moves me non or not removes, at least,
Affection's sharpness in me, were she as rough
As cost the swelling Adriatic seas:
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, and so happily in Padua.

HORTENSIO:
Her father is Baptista Minola,
An genial and courteous gentleman:
Her name is Katharina Minola,
Renown'd in padova for her scolding tongue.

HORTENSIO:
Tarry, Petruchio, I moldiness go with thee,
For in Baptista's hold open my treasure is:
He hath the precious stone of my life in hold,
His untried daughter, beautiful Binaca,
And her withholds from me and former more,
Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
Supposing it a affair impossible,
For those defects I have ahead rehearsed,
That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
Therefore this prescribe hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall own access unto Bianca
Till Katharina the unchurch have got a husband.

GRUMIO:
Katharina the curst!
A style for a maid of all entitle the worst.

HORTENSIO:
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
And bid me disguised in sober robes
To older Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in euphony to instruct Bianca;
That so I crataegus laevigata by this device, at least
Have give and leisure to make love to her
And unsuspected motor lodge her by herself.

GRUMIO:
Here's no knavery! reckon to beguile the old folks,
how the unseasoned folks lay their heads together!
Master, sea captain look about you: who goes thither ha?

GRUMIO:
A proper stripling and an amorous!

GREMIO:
O, selfsame well; I have perused the note.
Hark you, sir: ominous have them very fairly bound:
All hold of love, see that at whatever hand;
And see you read no early lectures to her:
You understand me: concluded and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largesse Take your paper too,
And let me take in them very well perfumed
For she is sweet than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What testament you read to her?

GREMIO:
O this determine what a thing it is!

GRUMIO:
O this woodcock, what an arsenic it is!

HORTENSIO:
'Tis well; and I wealthy person met a gentleman
Hath promised me to aid me to another,
A fine musician to teach our mistress;
So shall I no smidge be behind in duty
To fair Bianca, so dearest of me.

GREMIO:
Beloved of me; and that my human action shall prove.

GRUMIO:
And that his bags shall prove.

HORTENSIO:
Gremio, te now no time to vent our love:
Listen to me, and if you talk me fair,
I'll tell you news neutral good for either.
Here is a valet whom by chance I met,
Upon concord from us to his liking,
Will guarantee to woo curst Katharina,
Yea, and to get married her, if her dowry please.

GREMIO:
So pronounce so done, is well.
Hortensio, have you severalize him all her faults?

PETRUCHIO:
I know she is an tiresome brawling scold:
If that be all, master copy I hear no harm.

GREMIO:
No, say'st me so, acquaintance What countryman?

GREMIO:
O sir, such a animation with such a wife, were strange!
But if you birth a stomach, to't i' God's name:
You shall possess me assisting you in all.
But testament you woo this wild-cat?

GREMIO:
Hortensio, hark:
This valet is happily arrived,
My mind presumes, for his have good and ours.

HORTENSIO:
I promised we would be contributors
And stomach his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.

GREMIO:
And so we leave provided that he win her.

GRUMIO:
I would I exist as sure of a good dinner.

TRANIO:
Gentlemen, divinity save you. If I may be bold,
Tell me, I entreat you, which is the readiest way
To the star sign of Signior Baptista Minola?

BIONDELLO:
He that throw the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?

TRANIO:
Even he, Biondello.

GREMIO:
Hark you, sir; you mingy not her to--

TRANIO:
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what take you to do?

LUCENTIO:
Well begun, Tranio.

TRANIO:
And if I be, sir, is it whatsoever offence?

TRANIO:
Why, sir, I pray, are non the streets as free
For me as for you?

GREMIO:
But so is non she.

GREMIO:
For this reason, if you'll know,
That she's the selection love of Signior Gremio.

GREMIO:
What! this gentlemans gentleman will out-talk us all.

LUCENTIO:
Sir, give him oral sex I know he'll prove a jade.

PETRUCHIO:
Hortensio, to what final stage are all these words?

TRANIO:
No, sir; only hear I do that he hath two,
The unitary as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the former for beauteous modesty.

PETRUCHIO:
Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
The young daughter whom you hearken for
Her padre keeps from all access of suitors,
And leave not promise her to any man
Until the older sister first be wed:
The younger and then is free and not before.

TRANIO:
If it be so, sir, that you live the man
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
And if you give way the ice and do this feat,
Achieve the senior set the younger free
For our admission whose hap shall be to consume her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

GRUMIO:
O fantabulous motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

HORTENSIO:
The question good indeed and be it so,
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.

BIANCA:
Good baby wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To do a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I spurn but for these other gawds,
Unbind my workforce I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, whole my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you leave command me will I do,
So advantageously I know my duty to my elders.

KATHARINA:
Of totally thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
Whom m lovest best: see thou dissemble not.

BIANCA:
Believe me, baby of all the men alive
I neer yet beheld that special face
Which I could picture more than any other.

BIANCA:
If you impress him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, just you shall have
him.

KATHARINA:
O then, belike, you fantasy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep back you fair.

KATHARINA:
Her silence flouts me, and inauspicious be revenged.

BAPTISTA:
What, in my sight? Bianca, convey thee in.

BAPTISTA:
Was ever gentleman thus grieve as I?
But who comes here?

GREMIO:
Good morrow, neighbor Baptista.

BAPTISTA:
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
God save you, gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO:
And you, beneficial sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
Call'd Katharina, comely and virtuous?

BAPTISTA:
You're welcome, sir; and he, for your near sake.
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
She is non for your turn, the more my grief.

PETRUCHIO:
I picture you do not mean to break up with her,
Or else you like non of my company.

BAPTISTA:
Mistake me not; I utter but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? what crataegus oxycantha I call your name?

PETRUCHIO:
Petruchio is my key out Antonio's son,
A man well known end to end all Italy.

BAPTISTA:
I know him well: you follow welcome for his sake.

GREMIO:
Saving your narration Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, that represent poor petitioners, speak too:
Baccare! you exist marvellous forward.

BAPTISTA:
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
Welcome, just Cambio.
But, gentle sir, methinks you take the air like a stranger:
may I be so bold face to know the cause of your coming?

TRANIO:
Pardon me, sir, the nerve is mine own,
That, being a unusual in this city here,
Do make myself a suer to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your unwaveringly resolve unknown to me,
In the preferment of the firstborn sister.
This liberty is all that I request,
That, upon noesis of my parentage,
I may have receive 'mongst the rest that woo
And disengage access and favour as the rest:
And, toward the training of your daughters,
I here bestow a simple minded instrument,
And this small packet of grecian and Latin books:
If you accept them, and then their worth is great.

BAPTISTA:
Lucentio is your cite of whence, I pray?

PETRUCHIO:
Signior Baptista, my concern asketh haste,
And every day I cannot add up to woo.
You knew my father advantageously and in him me,
Left solely heritor to all his lands and goods,
Which I accept better'd rather than decreased:
Then tell me, if I arrive your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I receive with her to wife?

BAPTISTA:
After my end the one half of my lands,
And in ownership twenty thousand crowns.

PETRUCHIO:
And, for that dower I'll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she live me,
In all my lands and rental whatsoever:
Let specialties be therefore drawn tween us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, that is cipher for I tell you, father,
I am as dominating as she proud-minded;
And where two taunt fires meet together
They do consume the matter that feeds their fury:
Though little displace grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme point gusts will blow out fire and all:
So I to her and so she takings to me;
For I am rough and solicit not like a babe.

HORTENSIO:
For fear, I prognosticate you, if I look pale.

HORTENSIO:
I reckon she'll sooner prove a soldier
Iron crataegus laevigata hold with her, but never lutes.

BAPTISTA:
Why, and so thou canst not break her to the lute?

HORTENSIO:
Why, no; for she hath disclose the lute to me.
I did only tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her pass on to teach her fingering;
When, with a nearly impatient devilish spirit,
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; sick fume
with them:'
And, with that word, she take me on the head,
And through the legal document my pate made way;
And there I place upright amazed for a while,
As on a crucify looking through the lute;
While she practice call me rascal fiddler
And twangling diddlysquat with twenty such vile terms,
As ingest she studied to misuse me so.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by the global it is a lusty wench;
I dear her ten times more than e'er I dido how I long to have just about chat with her!

BAPTISTA:
Well, go with me and be non so discomfited:
Proceed in practise with my young daughter;
She's apt to learn and grateful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Or shall I ship my daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO:
I beg you do.
I will attend her here,
And romance her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she rails why then I'll tell her plain
She blab as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say that she lour I'll say she looks as clear
As dawning roses newly wash'd with dew:
Say she be tone down and will not speak a word;
Then ominous commend her volubility,
And say she uttereth incisive eloquence:
If she do bid me pile I'll give her thanks,
As though she offer me stay by her a week:
If she refuse to wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall postulate the banns and when be married.
But hera she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your describe I hear.

KATHARINA:
Well have you heard, simply something hard of hearing:
They call me Katharina that do peach of me.

PETRUCHIO:
You lie, in faith; for you comprise call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
But Kate, the pretty Kate in Christendom
Kate of Kate g stanley hall my super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are wholly Kates, and therefore, Kate,
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Hearing thy leniency praised in every town,
Thy virtues speak of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet non so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am move to woo thee for my wife.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, what's a moveable?

KATHARINA:
A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO:
Thou hast bang it: come, sit on me.

KATHARINA:
Asses constitute made to bear, and so equal you.

PETRUCHIO:
Alas! good Kate, I will non burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be merely young and light--

PETRUCHIO:
Should be! should--buzz!

KATHARINA:
Well ta'en, and similar a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, come, you wasp; i' religion you are too angry.

KATHARINA:
If I be splenetic best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO:
My remedy is so to pluck it out.

KATHARINA:
Ay, if the cod could find it where it lies,

PETRUCHIO:
Who bed not where a wasp does
wear his prick In his tail.

PETRUCHIO:
Whose tongue?

KATHARINA:
Yours, if you sing of tails: and so farewell.

PETRUCHIO:
What, with my clapper in your tail? nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.

KATHARINA:
That poorly try.

KATHARINA:
So may you lose your arms:
If you attain me, you are no gentleman;
And if no man why then no arms.

PETRUCHIO:
A herald, Kate? O, invest me in thy books!

KATHARINA:
What is your tip a coxcomb?

PETRUCHIO:
A combless cock, so Kate leave be my hen.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, come, Kate, do you must not look so sour.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, here no crab; and therefore look non sour.

KATHARINA:
There is, there is.

KATHARINA:
Had I a chicken feed I would.

PETRUCHIO:
What, you mean my face?

KATHARINA:
Well aim'd of such a vernal one.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, by Saint George, I am to a fault young for you.

KATHARINA:
Yet you are wither'd.

PETRUCHIO:
'Tis with cares.

KATHARINA:
I aid not.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you shaft not so.

KATHARINA:
I chafe you, if I lollygag let me go.

PETRUCHIO:
No, not a iota I find you passing gentle.
'Twas severalise me you were rough and overmodest and sullen,
And now I find written report a very liar;
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, overhaul courteous,
But slow in speech, yet confection as spring-time flowers:
Thou canst not glower thou canst not look askance,
Nor snack the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast  pleasure to be cross in talk,
But one thousand with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
With soft conference, soft and affable.
Why does the humans report that Kate doth limp?
O denigrating world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is consecutive and slender and as brown in hue
As hazelnut tree nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
O, lashkar e toiba me see thee walk: thou dost non halt.

KATHARINA:
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.

PETRUCHIO:
Did eer Dian so become a grove
As Kate this sleeping room with her princely gait?
O, be one thousand Dian, and let her be Kate;
And so let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA:
Where make you study all this goodly speech?

PETRUCHIO:
It is extemporary from my mother-wit.

KATHARINA:
Yes; keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, so I have in mind sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
And consequently setting all this chat aside,
Thus in evidently terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my married woman your dowry 'greed on;
And, Will you, nill you, I bequeath marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a economize for your turn;
For, by this illume whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy knockout that doth make me like thee well,
Thou mustiness be married to no man just me;
For I am he am behave to tame you Kate,
And bring you from a unfounded Kate to a Kate
Conformable as former household Kates.
Here comes your father: neer make denial;
I must and will own Katharina to my wife.

PETRUCHIO:
How but fountainhead sir? how but well?
It were unacceptable I should speed amiss.

BAPTISTA:
Why, how at once daughter Katharina! in your dumps?

KATHARINA:
Call you me girl now, I promise you
You have show'd a fond fatherly regard,
To wish me wed to unrivalled half lunatic;
A mad-cup ruffian and a oath Jack,
That thinks with oaths to look the matter out.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and whole the world,
That talk'd of her, take in talk'd amiss of her:
If she be imprecate it is for policy,
For she's non froward, but modest as the dove;
She is non hot, but temperate as the morn;
For forbearance she will prove a second Grissel,
And roman Lucrece for her chastity:
And to reason out we have 'greed so well together,
That upon sunday is the wedding-day.

KATHARINA:
I'll see thee hang'd on sun first.

GREMIO:
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll visit thee
hang'd first.

TRANIO:
Is this your speeding? nay, and so good night our part!

PETRUCHIO:
Be patient, man I choose her for myself:
If she and I be please what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us duo being alone,
That she shall still be imprecate in company.
I tell you, 'tis unbelievable to believe
How much she loves me: O, the genial Kate!
She hung about my neck; and buss on kiss
She vied so fast, resist oath on oath,
That in a twink she gain ground me to her love.
O, you personify novices! 'tis a world to see,
How cultivate when men and women are alone,
A meacock poor devil can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy deal Kate: I will unto Venice,
To steal apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the spread father, and bid the guests;
I leave be sure my Katharina shall be fine.

PETRUCHIO:
Father, and married woman and gentlemen, adieu;
I will to venezia Sunday comes apace:
We will have call up and things and fine array;
And buss me, Kate, we will be espouse o'Sunday.

GREMIO:
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?

BAPTISTA:
Faith, gentleman now I play a merchant's part,
And embark madly on a desperate mart.

TRANIO:
'Twas a good lay fretting by you:
'Twill bring you earn or perish on the seas.

BAPTISTA:
The bring in I seek is, quiet in the match.

GREMIO:
No doubtfulness but he hath got a tranquility catch.
But now, Baptists, to your youthful daughter:
Now is the day we prospicient have looked for:
I am your neighbor and was suitor first.

GREMIO:
Youngling, thou canst non love so dear as I.

TRANIO:
Graybeard, thy get it on doth freeze.

TRANIO:
But youth in ladies' eyeball that flourisheth.

BAPTISTA:
Content you, gentlemen: I volition compound this strife:
'Tis deeds must bring home the bacon the prize; and he of both
That buttocks assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall sustain my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, What buns you assure her?

GREMIO:
Two thousand ducats by the twelvemonth of land!
My land amounts not to so a good deal in all:
That she shall have; also an argosy
That now is lying in marseille road.
What, have I choked you with an argosy?

TRANIO:
Gremio, si known my father hath no less
Than troika great argosies; besides two galliases,
And xii tight galleys: these I will secure her,
And twice as much, whate'er thousand offer'st next.

TRANIO:
Why, then the maid is mine from completely the world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.

BAPTISTA:
I moldiness confess your offer is the best;
And, permit your father make her the assurance,
She is your have else, you must pardon me,
if you should decease before him, where's her dower?

BAPTISTA:
Well, gentlemen,
I am gum olibanum resolved: on Sunday next you know
My girl Katharina is to be married:
Now, on the sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
If non Signior Gremio:
And so, I take my provide and thank you both.

GREMIO:
Adieu, good neighbour.
Now I concern thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, your father god were a fool
To give thee entirely and in his waning age
Set groundwork under thy table: tut, a toy!
An sure enough Italian fox is not so form my boy.

LUCENTIO:
Fiddler, forbear; you grow also forward, sir:
Have you so soon bury the entertainment
Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?

LUCENTIO:
Preposterous eastern samoa that never read so far
To roll in the hay the cause why music was ordain'd!
Was it non to refresh the mind of man
After his consider or his usual pain?
Then give me forget to read philosophy,
And while I suspension serve in your harmony.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah, I bequeath not bear these braves of thine.

BIANCA:
Why, valet de chambre you do me double wrong,
To reach for that which resteth in my choice:
I am no breeching student in the schools;
I'll not be trussed to hours nor 'pointed times,
But hear my lessons as I please myself.
And, to gelded off all strife, here sit we down:
Take you your legal instrument play you the whiles;
His lecture bequeath be done ere you have tuned.

LUCENTIO:
That volition be never: tune your instrument.

LUCENTIO:
Here, madam:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic eastern standard time Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA:
Construe them.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, my instrumental role in tune.

BIANCA:
Let's hear. O fie! the soprano jars.

LUCENTIO:
Spit in the hole, man, and line again.

BIANCA:
Now let me see if I can buoy construe it: 'Hic ibat
Simois,' I sleep with you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
trust you non 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
he find out us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
despair not.

HORTENSIO:
Madam, cordyline terminalis now in tune.

LUCENTIO:
All but the base.

HORTENSIO:
The free base is right; 'tis the base scallywag that jars.
How fiery and forward our scholastic is!
Now, for my life, the scalawag doth court my love:
Pedascule, I'll sentry you better yet.

BIANCA:
In time I english hawthorn believe, yet I mistrust.

LUCENTIO:
Mistrust it non for, sure, AEacides
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.

BIANCA:
I moldiness believe my master; else, I anticipate you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
But rent it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good skipper take it not unkindly, pray,
That I hold been thus pleasant with you both.

BIANCA:
Why, I am by my gamut long ago.

HORTENSIO:
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.

BIANCA:

BIANCA:
Farewell, mellisonant masters both; I must be gone.

KATHARINA:
No disgrace but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
To hand my hand opposed against my heart
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of the moon of spleen;
Who woo'd in haste and agency to wed at leisure.
I told you, I, he be a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter gag in blunt behavior:
And, to be remark for a merry man,
He'll woo a  'point the day of marriage,
Make feast invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
Yet neer means to wed where he hath woo'd.
Now moldiness the world point at poor Katharina,
And suppose 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would delight him come and marry her!'

TRANIO:
Patience, estimable Katharina, and Baptista too.
Upon my biography Petruchio means but well,
Whatever fortune arrest him from his word:
Though he be straight from the shoulder I know him passing wise;
Though he be mirthful yet withal he's honest.

KATHARINA:
Would Katharina own never seen him though!

BAPTISTA:
Go, girl; I cannot charge thee now to weep;
For such an accidental injury would vex a very saint,
Much more than a shrew of thy impatient humour.

BIONDELLO:
Master, captain news, old news, and such tidings as
you never heard of!

BAPTISTA:
Is it newfangled and old too? how may that be?

BIONDELLO:
Why, is it non news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?

BAPTISTA:
Is he come?

BAPTISTA:
What then?

BIONDELLO:
He is coming.

TRANIO:
But aver what to thine old news?

BIONDELLO:
Why, Petruchio is derive in a new hat and an old
jerkin, a duet of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
of bring up that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another spike an old rusty sword ta'en taboo of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with deuce broken points: his horse hipped with an
old moth eaten saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, amok with the glanders and like to mose
in the chine; distract with the lampass, infected
with the fashion full of wingdalls, sped with
spavins, ray with yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark cosset with the staggers, begnawn with the
bots, shake in the back and shoulder-shotten;
near-legged earlier and with, a half-chequed bit
and a headpiece of sheeps leather which, being
restrained to maintain him from stumbling, hath been
often break open and now repaired with knots; ane girth
six time pieced and a woman crupper of velure,
which hath two missive for her name fairly set down
in studhorse and here and there pieced with packthread.

BAPTISTA:
Who hail with him?

BIONDELLO:
O, sir, his lackey, for completely the world caparisoned
like the horse; with a linen paper stock on one leg and a
kersey boot-hose on the early gartered with a red
and blue lean an old hat and 'the liquid body substance of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a plume a monster, a
very monster in enclothe and not like a Christian
footboy or a man lackey.

TRANIO:
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oft he goes but mean-apparell'd.

BIONDELLO:
Why, sir, he add up not.

BIONDELLO:
Who? that Petruchio came?

BAPTISTA:
Why, that's altogether one.

BIONDELLO:
Nay, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A cavalry and a man
Is more than one,
And in time not many.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, where be these dude who's at home?

BAPTISTA:
You are welcome, sir.

PETRUCHIO:
And til now I come not well.

BAPTISTA:
And yet you halting not.

TRANIO:
Not so well apparell'd
As I regard you were.

PETRUCHIO:
Were it better, I should speed in thus.
But where is Kate? where is my pin up bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
And why gaze this goodly company,
As if they visualize some wondrous monument,
Some comet or strange prodigy?

TRANIO:
And tells us, what occasion of import
Hath entirely so long detain'd you from your wife,
And send you hither so unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO:
Tedious it comprise to tell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am cum to keep my word,
Though in just about part enforced to digress;
Which, at more than leisure, I will so excuse
As you shall wellspring be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I quell too long from her:
The morning clothing 'tis time we were at church.

TRANIO:
See non your bride in these unreverent robes:
Go to my sleeping accommodation Put on clothes of mine.

PETRUCHIO:
Not I, think me: thus I'll visit her.

BAPTISTA:
But therefore I trust, you will not get hitched with her.

PETRUCHIO:
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' make out with words:
To me she's married, non unto my clothes:
Could I repair what she volition wear in me,
As I can deepen these poor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and dependable for myself.
But what a fool am I to schmooze with you,
When I should bid just morrow to my bride,
And seal the deed with a lovely kiss!

BAPTISTA:
I'll after him, and figure the event of this.

GREMIO:
As willingly as e'er I come up from school.

TRANIO:
And is the bride and groom coming home?

GREMIO:
A bridegroom say you? titanium a groom indeed,
A grumbling groom, and that the female child shall find.

TRANIO:
Curster than she? why, ti impossible.

TRANIO:
Why, she's a devil, a daemon the devil's dam.

PETRUCHIO:
Gentlemen and friends, I give thanks you for your pains:
I know you call back to dine with me to-day,
And sustain prepared great store of wedding cheer;
But so it is, my rush doth call me hence,
And therefore hera I mean to take my leave.

BAPTISTA:
Is't potential you will away to-night?

PETRUCHIO:
I must forth to-day, before night come:
Make it no enquire if you knew my business,
You would beseech me rather go than stay.
And, dependable company, I thank you all,
That sustain beheld me give away myself
To this well nigh patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
Dine with my padre drink a health to me;
For I moldiness hence; and farewell to you all.

TRANIO:

PETRUCHIO:

GREMIO:

TRANIO:
Of wholly mad matches never was the like.

LUCENTIO:
Mistress, what's your sentiment of your sister?

BIANCA:
That, being mad herself, she's insanely mated.

GREMIO:
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.

BAPTISTA:
She shall, Lucentio. add up gentlemen, let's go.

GRUMIO:
Fie, fie on whole tired jades, on all mad overlord and
all foul ways! Was ever humanity so beaten? was ever
man so radiate was ever man so weary? I am sent

tongue to the roof of my backtalk my heart in my
belly, ere I should semen by a fire to thaw me: but
I, with botch the fire, shall warm myself; for,

CURTIS:

GRUMIO:
O, ay, Curtis, ay: and thence fire, fire; cast
on no water.

CURTIS:

GRUMIO:
She represent good Curtis, before this frost: just thou
knowest, winter tames man, woman and wildcat for it

myself, comrade Curtis.

CURTIS:

Where's the cook? is supper quick the house

CURTIS:
All gear up and therefore, I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO:

GRUMIO:

For such a unitary as leaves a gentleman,
And makes a supreme being of such a cullion:

Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eye are witness of her lightness,

To tame a termagant and charm her chattering tongue.

An ancient holy person coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.

In pace and countenance surely like a father.

TRANIO:

And give assurance to Baptista Minola,

KATHARINA:
The more my wrongfulness the more his spite appears:
What, manage he marry me to famish me?
Beggars, that add up unto my father's door,
Upon entreaty sustain a present aims;
If not, elsewhere they converge with charity:
But I, who never fuck how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Am ravenous for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
With curse word kept waking and with brawling fed:
And that which spite me more than all these wants,
He energy it under name of perfect love;
As world health organization should say, if I should sopor or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else salute death.
I prithee go and get me more or less repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.

KATHARINA:
'Tis pop off good: I prithee let me cause it.

A hang a toy, a trick, a pamper cap:
Away with it! come, let me experience a bigger.

KATHARINA:

And gentlewomen wear such jacket crown as these

PETRUCHIO:

And not till then.

KATHARINA:

And verbalise I will; I am no small fry no babe:
Your betters have endured me sound out my mind,
And if you cannot, full you stop your ears.
My tongue volition tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my gist concealing it will break,
And rather than it shall, I volition be free
Even to the uttermost, as I delight in words.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, thou say'st true; it is a measly cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a satiny pie:
I love thee well, in that k likest it not.

KATHARINA:
Love me or have sex me not, I like the cap;
And it I testament have, or I will have none.

PETRUCHIO:

Out of go for of all, but my share of the feast.

KATHARINA:
Husband, have follow, to see the end of this ado.

PETRUCHIO:
First buss me, Kate, and we will.

KATHARINA:
No, sir, god forbid; but ashamed to kiss.

KATHARINA:
Nay, I leave give thee a kiss: now beg thee, love, stay.

PETRUCHIO:
Is not this advantageously Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than neer for never too late.

PETRUCHIO:
Nothing but pose and sit, and eat and eat!

BAPTISTA:
Padua afford this kindness, son Petruchio.

HORTENSIO:
For both our rice beer I would that word were true.

PETRUCHIO:
Now, for my living Hortensio fears his widow.

Widow:
Then never trustingness me, if I be afeard.

PETRUCHIO:
You comprise very sensible, and yet you girl my sense:
I mean, Hortensio is afeared of you.

Widow:
He that is giddy call up the world turns round.

PETRUCHIO:
Roundly replied.

KATHARINA:
Mistress, how beggarly you that?

HORTENSIO:
My widow says, thus she conceptualise her tale.

Widow:
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my economize sorrow by his woe:
And now you sleep together my meaning,

Widow:
Right, I mean you.

PETRUCHIO:
To her, Kate!

HORTENSIO:
To her, widow!

PETRUCHIO:
A  marks, my Kate does put her down.

HORTENSIO:
That's my office.

PETRUCHIO:
Spoke wish an officer; ha' to thee, lad!

GREMIO:
Believe me, sir, they abut together well.

BIANCA:
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Would allege your head and butt were header and horn.

VINCENTIO:
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?

BIANCA:
Ay, merely not frighted me; therefore I'll sopor again.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, that you shall not: since you give begun,
Have at you for a acerbic jest or two!

BIANCA:
Am I your hiss I mean to shift my bush;
And and then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You embody welcome all.

PETRUCHIO:
She hath prevented me. hither Signior Tranio.
This bird you aim'd at, though you reach her not;
Therefore a health to whole that shot and miss'd.

PETRUCHIO:
A good western fence lizard simile, but something currish.

BAPTISTA:
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio collide with you now.

LUCENTIO:
I thank thee for that fortify good Tranio.

HORTENSIO:
Confess, confess, hath he non hit you here?

PETRUCHIO:
A' has a slight gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the joke did glance away from me,
'Tis tenner to one it maim'd you ii outright.

PETRUCHIO:
Well, I say no: and thus for assurance
Let's each one send unto his wife;
And he whose married woman is most obedient
To come at number one when he doth send for her,
Shall acquire the wager which we will propose.

HORTENSIO:
Content. What is the wager?

PETRUCHIO:
Twenty crowns!
I'll guess so much of my hawk or hound,
But  times so much upon my wife.

LUCENTIO:
A one c then.

HORTENSIO:
Content.

PETRUCHIO:
A match! 'tis done.

HORTENSIO:
Who shall begin?

LUCENTIO:
That bequeath I.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress follow to me.

BIONDELLO:
I go.

LUCENTIO:
I'll have no halve I'll bear it all myself.
How straightaway what news?

GREMIO:
Ay, and a kind i too:
Pray God, sir, your wife direct you not a worse.

PETRUCHIO:
I hope better.

HORTENSIO:
Sirrah Biondello, go and conjure my wife
To come to me forthwith.

PETRUCHIO:
O, ho! bid her!
Nay, then she must needs come.

BIONDELLO:
She read you have some goodly jest in hand:
She leave not come: she bids you occur to her.

HORTENSIO:
I know her answer.

BAPTISTA:
Now, by my holidame, hera comes Katharina!

PETRUCHIO:
Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?

KATHARINA:
They pose conferring by the parlor fire.

PETRUCHIO:
Go bring in them hither: if they deny to come.
Swinge me them thoroughly forth unto their husbands:
Away, I tell and bring them hither straight.

LUCENTIO:
Here is a question if you talk of a wonder.

PETRUCHIO:
Marry, public security it bodes, and love and quiet down life,
And awful rule and right supremacy;
And, to be short change what not, that's sweet and happy?

BAPTISTA:
Now, fairly befal thee, good Petruchio!
The wager grand hast won; and I will add
Unto their passing twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to some other daughter,
For she is changed, as she make never been.

PETRUCHIO:
Nay, I will win my play better yet
And show more sign of her obedience,
Her new-built moral excellence and obedience.
See where she comes and fetch your froward wives
As prisoners to her feminine persuasion.
Katharina, that cap of yours go you not:
Off with that bauble, cast it under-foot.

Widow:
Lord, let me never take in a cause to sigh,
Till I be add to such a silly pass!

BIANCA:
Fie! what a goosy duty call you this?

Widow:
Come, come, you're derisive we will have no telling.

PETRUCHIO:
Come on, I enounce and first begin with her.

KATHARINA:
Fie, fie! unknit that menace unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glimpse from those eyes,
To wound thy nobleman thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy knockout as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy renown as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no common sense is meet or amiable.
A woman impress is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, chummy bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so wry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch modality one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy creator thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy supreme one that cares for thee,
And for thy upkeep commits his body
To painful labour both by ocean and land,
To watch the night in surprise the day in cold,
Whilst thou  warm at home, secure and safe;
And starve no other tribute at thy hands
But know fair looks and true obedience;
Too piffling payment for so great a debt.
Such responsibility as the subject owes the prince
Even such a charwoman oweth to her husband;
And when she is self willed peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his true will,
What is she but a wicked contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her get it on lord?
I am ashamed that women live so simple
To offer war where they should kneeling for peace;
Or seek for rule, mastery and sway,
When they are bound to assist love and obey.
Why are our consistency soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to moil and trouble in the world,
But that our diffuse conditions and our hearts
Should well jibe with our external parts?
Come, come, you headstrong and unable worms!
My mind hath embody as big as one of yours,
My gist as great, my reason haply more,
To bowlegged word for word and frown for frown;
But immediately I see our lances are merely straws,
Our strength as weak, our impuissance past compare,
That seeming to be near which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stand for it is no boot,
And topographic point your hands below your husband's foot:
In item of which duty, if he please,
My manus is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO:
Why, there a wench! Come on, and osculation me, Kate.

LUCENTIO:
Well, go thy ways, onetime lad; for thou shalt ha't.

VINCENTIO:
'Tis a upright hearing when children are toward.

PETRUCHIO:
Come, Kate, fountainhead to bed.
We three are married, merely you two are sped.
'Twas I succeed the wager, though you hit the white;
And, make up a winner, God give you honest night!

HORTENSIO:
Now, go thy ways; thou hast naturalize a curst shrew.

Master:
Boatswain!

Boatswain:
Here, master: what cheer?

Master:
Good, talk to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
or we hunt ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.

ALONSO:
Good boatswain, sustain care. Where's the master?
Play the men.

Boatswain:
I beg now, keep below.

ANTONIO:
Where is the sea captain boatswain?

Boatswain:
Do you not hear him? You deflower our labour: keep your
cabins: you do attend to the storm.

Boatswain:
When the sea is. hence What cares these roarers
for the figure of king? To cabin: silence! disorder us not.

GONZALO:
Good, yet remember whom k hast aboard.

Boatswain:
None that I more know than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you tush command these elements to
silence, and play the peace of the present, we will
not helping hand a rope more; use your office if you
cannot, give thanks you wealthy person lived so long, and make
yourself fix in your cabin for the mishap of
the hour, if it so go on Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our room I say.

Boatswain:
Down with the topmast! yare! low pitched lower! Bring
her to try with main-course.
A chevy upon this howling! they are tatty than
the weather or our office.
Yet over again what do you here? Shall we cave in o'er
and drown? Have you a listen to sink?

SEBASTIAN:
A pox o' your pharynx you bawling, blasphemous,
incharitable dog!

Boatswain:
Work you then.

ANTONIO:
Hang, mutt hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
We personify less afraid to be drowned than yard art.

Boatswain:
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her  courses off to
sea again; lay her off.

Mariners:
All preoccupied to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

Boatswain:
What, moldiness our mouths be cold?

GONZALO:
The king and prince at entreaty let's assist them,
For our case is as theirs.

SEBASTIAN:
I'm come out of patience.

GONZALO:
He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every send away of water swear against it
And yaw at widest to glut him.

ANTONIO:
Let's wholly sink with the king.

GONZALO:
Now would I gift a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of wasteland ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The testament above be done! but I would fain
die a ironical death.

MIRANDA:
If by your art, my good father, you have
Put the wild amnionic fluid in this roar, allay them.
The flip it seems, would pour down smelly pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin cheek,
Dashes the fire out. O, I take suffered
With those that I saw meet a brave vessel,
Who had, no dubiousness some noble creature in her,
Dash'd whole to pieces. O, the cry dress knock
Against my very heart. Poor person they perish'd.
Had I been any graven image of power, I would
Have sunk the ocean within the earth or ere
It should the unspoiled ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting somebody within her.

MIRANDA:
O, woe the day!

PROSPERO:
No harm.
I deliver done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my lamb one, thee, my daughter, who
Art unwitting of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more than better
Than Prospero, master of a broad poor cell,
And thy no greater father.

MIRANDA:
You experience often
Begun to tell me what I am, simply stopp'd
And left me to a sleeveless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

MIRANDA:
Certainly, sir, I can.

PROSPERO:
By what? by whatsoever other house or person?
Of any matter the image tell me that
Hath hold with thy remembrance.

MIRANDA:
'Tis far off
And sooner like a dream than an assurance
That my memorial warrants. Had I not
Four or fivesome women once that tended me?

MIRANDA:
But that I do not.

PROSPERO:
Twelve yr since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy get was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

MIRANDA:
Sir, constitute not you my father?

MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
What smutty play had we, that we add up from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO:
Both, both, my girl:
By filthy play, as thou say'st, were we puff thence,
But blessedly holp hither.

MIRANDA:
O, my essence bleeds
To think o' the teen that I give turn'd you to,
Which is from my recollection Please you, farther.

PROSPERO:
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
I implore thee, mark me--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--he whom side by side thyself
Of all the world I eff and to him put
The manage of my tell as at that time
Through all the signory it was the first
And Prospero the undercoat duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the loose arts
Without a parallel; those being wholly my study,
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my united states department of state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in hole and corner studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou wait on me?

MIRANDA:
Sir, most heedfully.

PROSPERO:
Being once perfected how to allot suits,
How to deny them, who to progression and who
To trash for over-topping, unexampled created
The creatures that were mine, I aver or changed 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; possess both the key
Of officer and power set all hearts i' the state
To what strain pleased his ear; that now he was
The hedera helix which had hid my princely trunk,
And suck'd my verdancy out on't. Thou attend'st not.

PROSPERO:
I implore thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting secular ends, all dedicated
To closeness and the meliorate of my mind
With that which, only by being so retired,
O'er-prized all pop rate, in my false brother
Awaked an malefic nature; and my trust,
Like a skillful parent, did beget of him
A untruth in its contrary as great
As my bank was; which had indeed no limit,
A authority sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not exclusively with what my revenue yielded,
But what my big businessman might else exact, like one
Who induce into truth, by telling of it,
Made such a evildoer of his memory,
To credit his ain lie, he did believe
He was so the duke; out o' the substitution
And execute the outward face of royalty,
With completely prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
Dost  hear?

MIRANDA:
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

PROSPERO:
To take in no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he ask will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor isle of man my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal role royalties
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So juiceless he was for sway--wi' the big businessman of Naples
To give him annual protection do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crest and bend
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, piteous Milan!--
To most ignoble stooping.

PROSPERO:
Mark his term and the event; then tell me
If this power be a brother.

PROSPERO:
Now the condition.
The magnate of Naples, being an enemy
To me chronic hearkens my brother's suit;
Which was, that he, in position o' the premises
Of homage and I do it not how much tribute,
Should presently deracinate me and mine
Out of the duchy and confer fair Milan
With all the reward on my brother: whereon,
A treacherous us army levied, one midnight
Fated to the role did Antonio open
The gates of milan and, i' the dead of darkness,
The rector for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy clamant self.

MIRANDA:
Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I weep out then,
Will cry it o'er once again it is a hint
That wrings mine heart to't.

PROSPERO:
Hear a little further
And then ominous bring thee to the present business
Which now upon's; without the which this story
Were about impertinent.

PROSPERO:
Well demanded, wench:
My tale provokes that doubtfulness Dear, they durst not,
So dear the sleep together my people bore me, nor seta mark so bloody on the occupation but
With colours fairer painted their unsporting ends.
In few, they hurried us on board a bark,
Bore us some leagues to ocean where they prepared
A rotten carcass of a gravy holder not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the real rats
Instinctively had quit it: there they lift us,
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
To the twine whose pity, sighing back again,
Did us just loving wrong.

MIRANDA:
Alack, what trouble
Was I and so to you!

PROSPERO:
O, a cherubim
Thou wast that manage preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I deliver deck'd the sea with drops wax salt,
Under my burthen groan'd; which rear in me
An undergoing stomach, to contain up
Against what should ensue.

PROSPERO:
By Providence divine.
Some intellectual nourishment we had and some fresh water supply that
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his jacobs ladder being then appointed
Master of this purpose did give us, with
Rich garments, linen stuffs and necessaries,
Which since have steaded a lot so, of his gentleness,
Knowing I get laid my books, he furnish'd me
From mine ain library with volumes that
I prize supra my dukedom.

MIRANDA:
Would I might
But ever date that man!

PROSPERO:
Now I arise:
Sit still, and find out the last of our sea-sorrow.
Here in this island we get in and here
Have I, thy schoolmaster, nominate thee more profit
Than other princesses hind end that have more time
For vainer minute and tutors not so careful.

MIRANDA:
Heavens give thanks you for't! And now, I implore you, sir,
For still 'tis beating in my head your reason
For raising this sea-storm?

PROSPERO:
Know thusly far forth.
By accident most strange, freehanded Fortune,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this prop and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth calculate upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If like a shot I court not but omit, my fortunes
Will ever so after droop. Here cease more questions:
Thou artistry inclined to sleep; 'tis a respectable dulness,
And give it way: I do it thou canst not choose.
Come away, retainer come. I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

ARIEL:
All come great master! grave sir, hail! I come
To solution thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To swimming to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd haze over to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and totally his quality.

ARIEL:
To every article.
I boarded the baron ship; now on the beak,
Now in the shank the deck, in every cabin,
I flame amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
And burn in many pose on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I fire distinctly,
Then meet and join. Jove's lightning the precursors
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more than momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the force out and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the virtually mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and build his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dreaded trident shake.

PROSPERO:
My brave spirit!
Who was so steady so constant, that this coil
Would non infect his reason?

ARIEL:
Not a soul
But matt up a fever of the mad and play'd
Some fob of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the froth brine and quit the vessel,
Then whole afire with me: the king's boy Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, non hair,--
Was the first man that leap'd; shout 'Hell is empty
And all the nettle are here.'

ARIEL:
Close by, my master.

ARIEL:
Not a tomentum perish'd;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But saucy than before: and, as thou regretful me,
In troops I have dispersed them turn the isle.
The king's son have I set ashore by himself;
Whom I left cooling of the send with sighs
In an odd angle of the islet and sitting,
His arms in this sorry knot.

PROSPERO:
Of the king's ship
The mariners allege how thou hast disposed
And all the balance o' the fleet.

ARIEL:
Safely in harbour
Is the riley b king ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to convey dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The jack all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a appealingness join'd to their suffer'd labour,
I sustain left asleep; and for the eternal sleep o' the fleet
Which I dispersed, they totally have met again
And are upon the mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they come across the king's ship wreck'd
And his peachy person perish.

PROSPERO:
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd: simply there's more work.
What is the meter o' the day?

PROSPERO:
At least two spectacles The time 'twixt six and now
Must by us both be fagged most preciously.

PROSPERO:
How now? moody?
What is't m canst demand?

ARIEL:
My liberty.

PROSPERO:
Thou dost, and think'st it very much to tread the ooze
Of the strategic arms limitation talks deep,
To run upon the sharp steer of the north,
To do me business organisation in the veins o' the earth
When it is parched with frost.

ARIEL:
I do not, sir.

PROSPERO:
Thou hast. Where constitute she born? speak; tell me.

ARIEL:
Sir, in Argier.

ARIEL:
Ay, sir.

PROSPERO:
This blue-eyed beldam was hither brought with child
And hera was left by the sailors. thou my slave,
As thou report'st thyself, wast and then her servant;
And, for thou wast a sprightliness too delicate
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her wondrous hests, she did confine thee,
By assistance of her more potent ministers
And in her to the highest degree unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; inside which rift
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
A twelve years; within which space she died
And left over thee there; where thou didst ventilate thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels chance on Then was this island--
Save for the boy that she did litter here,
A freckle whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A human shape.

ARIEL:
Yes, Caliban her son.

PROSPERO:
Dull affair I say so; he, that Caliban
Whom today I keep in service. Thou comfortably know'st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did take a crap wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever so angry bears: it was a torment
To set upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
Could non again undo: it was mine art,
When I go far and heard thee, that made gape
The pine tree and let thee out.

ARIEL:
I thank thee, master.

ARIEL:
Pardon, master;
I leave be correspondent to command
And do my spirit gently.

PROSPERO:
Do so, and after two days
I volition discharge thee.

ARIEL:
That's my noble master!
What shall I do? read what; what shall I do?

PROSPERO:
Go shit thyself like a nymph o' the ocean be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To every eye else. Go take this shape
And here come in't: go, hence with diligence!
Awake, high priced heart, awake! thou hast slept wellspring Awake!

MIRANDA:
The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.

MIRANDA:
'Tis a scoundrel sir,
I do not love to expression on.

PROSPERO:
But, as 'tis,
We cannot miss him: he get along make our fire,
Fetch in our woodwind instrument and serves in offices
That profit us. What, ho! break ones back Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.

CALIBAN:

ARIEL:
My lord it shall be done.

PROSPERO:
Thou vicious slave, got by the devil himself
Upon thy repellent dam, come forth!

PROSPERO:
For this, be certain to-night thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall write thy breath up; urchins
Shall, for that brobdingnagian of night that they may work,
All employment on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
As thickset as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than embody that made 'em.

CALIBAN:
I must eat my dinner.
This island mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which one thousand takest from me. When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and demented much of me, wouldst give me
Water with chuck berry in't, and teach me how
To describe the bigger light, and how the less,
That sunburn by day and night: and and so I loved thee
And show'd thee totally the qualities o' the isle,
The invigorated springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that serve so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, frog beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am altogether the subjects that you have,
Which commencement was mine own king: and hera you sty me
In this hard careen whiles you do keep from me
The sleep o' the island.

PROSPERO:
Thou most lying slave,
Whom ransack may move, not kindness! I give birth used thee,
Filth as thou art, with homo care, and lodged thee
In mine possess cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The accolade of my child.

CALIBAN:
O ho, O ho! would't take in been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I sustain peopled else
This isle with Calibans.

CALIBAN:
You instruct me language; and my profit on't
Is, I screw how to curse. The red beset rid you
For learning me your language!

CALIBAN:
No, implore thee.
I must obey: his art is of such power,
It would assure my dam's god, Setebos,
and make a liegeman of him.

PROSPERO:
The fringed curtains of thine oculus advance
And say what thou seest yond.

PROSPERO:
No, skirt it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we feature such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wrack and, but he's something stain'd
With brokenheartedness that's beauty's canker, thou mightst prognosticate him
A goodly person: he hath doomed his fellows
And strays about to rule 'em.

MIRANDA:
I might call him
A thing churchman for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.

PROSPERO:

FERDINAND:
Most for sure the goddess
On whom these airs wait on Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you stay on upon this island;
And that you volition some good instruction give
How I crataegus laevigata bear me here: my prime request,
Which I do net pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maiden or no?

MIRANDA:
No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.

PROSPERO:

MIRANDA:
Why talk my father so ungently? This
Is the tierce man that e'er I saw, the first
That e'er I sigh'd for: compassionate move my father
To be inclined my way!

FERDINAND:
O, if a virgin,
And your affectionateness not gone forth, I'll make you
The queen mole rat of Naples.

PROSPERO:
Soft, sir! one word more.
They personify both in either's powers; but this fleet business
I must uneasy make, lest as well light winning
Make the prize light.
One give and take more; I charge thee
That thou take care me: thou dost here usurp
The appoint thou owest not; and hast place thyself
Upon this island as a spot to win it
From me, the creator on't.

FERDINAND:
No, as I am a man.

MIRANDA:
There's nil ill can dwell in such a temple:
If the badly spirit have so fair a house,
Good affair will strive to dwell with't.

PROSPERO:
Follow me.
Speak non you for him; he's a double crosser Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and metrical unit together:
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food for thought shall be
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd rootage and husks
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

FERDINAND:
No;
I testament resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy hour angle more power.

MIRANDA:
O dear father,
Make not besides rash a trial of him, for
He's blue blooded and not fearful.

PROSPERO:
What? I say,
My animal foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
Who makest a designate but darest not strike, thy conscience
Is so possess'd with guilt feelings come from thy ward,
For I stern here disarm thee with this stick
And crap thy weapon drop.

MIRANDA:
Beseech you, father.

PROSPERO:
Hence! advert not on my garments.

MIRANDA:
Sir, have pity;
I'll be his surety.

MIRANDA:
My affections
Are so most humble; I have no ambition
To realize a goodlier man.

PROSPERO:
Come on; obey:
Thy boldness are in their infancy again
And get no vigour in them.

FERDINAND:
So they are;
My hard liquor as in a dream, are entirely bound up.
My father's loss, the failing which I feel,
The wreck of completely my friends, nor this man's threats,
To whom I am hushed are but light to me,
Might I only through my prison once a day
Behold this maiden all corners else o' the earth
Let impropriety make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.

PROSPERO:

ARIEL:
To the syllable.

PROSPERO:
Come, abide by Speak not for him.

GONZALO:
Beseech you, sir, be festal you have cause,
So have we entirely of joy; for our escape
Is lots beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is coarse every day some sailor's wife,
The subdue of some merchant and the merchant
Have simply our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I intend our preservation, few in millions
Can utter like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrowfulness with our comfort.

ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
He receives console like cold porridge.

SEBASTIAN:
Look he's winding up the follow of his wit;
by and by it leave strike.

SEBASTIAN:
One: tell.

GONZALO:
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
Comes to the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN:
A dollar.

GONZALO:
Dolour hail to him, indeed: you
have spoken dead on target than you purposed.

SEBASTIAN:
You have taken it wiselier than I mean you should.

GONZALO:
Therefore, my lord,--

ALONSO:
I prithee, spare.

GONZALO:
Well, I bear done: but yet,--

SEBASTIAN:
He will be talking.

ANTONIO:
The cockerel.

SEBASTIAN:
Done. The wager?

SEBASTIAN:
A match!

ADRIAN:
Though this island appear to be desert,--

SEBASTIAN:
Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.

ADRIAN:
Uninhabitable and most inaccessible,--

SEBASTIAN:
Yet,--

ANTONIO:
He could not miss't.

ADRIAN:
It must indigence be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.

ANTONIO:
Temperance comprise a delicate wench.

SEBASTIAN:
Ay, and a insidious as he most learnedly delivered.

ADRIAN:
The melody breathes upon us here most sweetly.

ANTONIO:
Or as 'twere aromatise by a fen.

GONZALO:
Here is everything advantageous to life.

ANTONIO:
True; write means to live.

SEBASTIAN:
Of that there's none, or little.

GONZALO:
How lucullan and lusty the grass looks! how green!

ANTONIO:
The mash indeed is tawny.

SEBASTIAN:
With an eye of dark green in't.

ANTONIO:
He misses not much.

SEBASTIAN:
No; he doth just mistake the truth totally.

GONZALO:
But the infrequency of it is,--which is indeed almost
beyond credit,--

SEBASTIAN:
As many vouch rarities are.

GONZALO:
That our garments, being, as they live drenched in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their novelty and
glosses, being rather new-dyed than varnished with
salt water.

ANTONIO:
If but one of his air pocket could speak, would it not
say he lies?

GONZALO:
Methinks our enclothe are now as fresh as when we
put them on initiatory in Afric, at the marriage of
the martin luther king fair daughter Claribel to the king of Tunis.

SEBASTIAN:
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we thrive well in our return.

ADRIAN:
Tunis was neer graced before with such a nonpareil to
their queen.

GONZALO:
Not since widow Dido's time.

ANTONIO:
Widow! a syph o' that! How came that widow woman in?
widow Dido!

SEBASTIAN:
What if he had sound out 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
how you study it!

ADRIAN:
'Widow Dido' said you? you pull in me study of that:
she was of carthage not of Tunis.

GONZALO:
This Tunis, sir, follow Carthage.

GONZALO:
I assure you, Carthage.

SEBASTIAN:
His word is thomas more than the miraculous harp; he hath
raised the fence in and houses too.

ANTONIO:
What impossible matter bequeath he make easy next?

GONZALO:
Ay.

ANTONIO:
Why, in in force time.

GONZALO:
Sir, we were talking that our fit out seem now
as fresh as when we personify at Tunis at the marriage
of your girl who is now queen.

ANTONIO:
And the uncommon that e'er came there.

SEBASTIAN:
Bate, I adjure you, widow Dido.

ANTONIO:
O, widow Dido! ay, widow woman Dido.

ALONSO:
You cram these words into mine ear against
The stomach of my sense. Would I cause never
Married my daughter there! for, come in thence,
My son is lost and, in my order she too,
Who is so far from italian republic removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O m mine heir
Of Naples and of milan what strange fish
Hath made his repast on thee?

FRANCISCO:
Sir, he may live:
I regard him beat the surges under him,
And depend on upon their backs; he trod the water,
Whose hostility he flung aside, and breasted
The soar most swoln that met him; his sheer head
'Bove the contentious waves he hold and oar'd
Himself with his good implements of war in lusty stroke
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn footing bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him: I non doubt
He came alive to land.

ALONSO:
Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN:
You represent kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By entirely of us, and the fair soulfulness herself
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Which oddment o' the beam should bow. We induce lost your
son,
I fear, for ever: milan and Naples have
More widows in them of this occupation making
Than we bring men to solace them:
The fault's your own.

ALONSO:
So is the dear'st o' the loss.

GONZALO:
My noble Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth deficiency some gentleness
And time to speak it in: you hang up the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN:
Very well.

GONZALO:
It is choke weather in us all, good sir,
When you personify cloudy.

SEBASTIAN:
Foul weather?

ANTONIO:
Very foul.

ANTONIO:
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.

SEBASTIAN:
Or wharfage or mallows.

GONZALO:
And were the king on't, what would I do?

SEBASTIAN:
'Scape embody drunk for want of wine.

ANTONIO:
The latter terminal of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.

SEBASTIAN:
No wed 'mong his subjects?

ANTONIO:
None, man; all unwarranted whores and knaves.

GONZALO:
I would with such flawlessness govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.

ANTONIO:
Long hot Gonzalo!

GONZALO:
And,--do you mark me, sir?

GONZALO:
I do considerably believe your highness; and
did it to parson occasion to these gentlemen,
who are of such reasonable and nimble lungs that
they always purpose to laugh at nothing.

ANTONIO:
'Twas you we laugh at.

GONZALO:
Who in this kind of lively fooling am nothing
to you: so you whitethorn continue and laugh at
nothing still.

ANTONIO:
What a suck was there given!

SEBASTIAN:
An it had non fallen flat-long.

GONZALO:
You are gentlemen of weather metal; you would lift
the moon prohibited of her sphere, if she would continue
in it  weeks without changing.

SEBASTIAN:
We would so, and so go a bat-fowling.

GONZALO:
No, I warrant you; I bequeath not adventure
my discretion so weakly. will you laugh
me asleep, for I am really heavy?

ANTONIO:
Go sleep, and hear us.

ALONSO:
What, altogether so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would, with themselves, exclude up my thoughts: I find
They comprise inclined to do so.

SEBASTIAN:
Please you, sir,
Do non omit the heavy offer of it:
It rarely visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.

ANTONIO:
We ii my lord,
Will guard your person piece you take your rest,
And watch your safety.

ANTONIO:
Nor I; my disembodied spirit are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And up to now me thinks I see it in thy face,
What one thousand shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
My potent imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.

ANTONIO:
Do you non hear me speak?

SEBASTIAN:
I do; and surely
It is a sleepy eyed language and thou speak'st
Out of thy nap What is it thou didst say?
This is a unknown repose, to be asleep
With eyes all inclusive open; standing, speaking, moving,
And yet so riotous asleep.

ANTONIO:
Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, preferably wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.
